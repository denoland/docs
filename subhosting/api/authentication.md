title: Authentication
---

Developers can provision projects, domains, KV databases, and other resources
using the Subhosting REST API.

## Endpoint and authentication

The base URL for the Subhosting REST API v1 is below.

```console
https://api.deno.com/v1/
```

The v1 API uses
[HTTP bearer token](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/bearer-authentication/)
authentication. You can create an access token to use the API in the dashboard
[here](https://dash.deno.com/account#access-tokens). Most API requests will also
require your organization ID. You can retrieve yours from the Deno Deploy
dashboard for your organization.

Using both your organization ID and your access token, you can test your API
access by listing all the projects associated with your organization. Here is an
example Deno script you can use to access the API.

```typescript
// Replace these with your own!
const organizationId = "a75a9caa-b8ac-47b3-a423-3f2077c58731";
const token = "ddo_u7mo08lBNHm8GMGLhtrEVfcgBsCuSp36dumX";

const res = await fetch(
  `https://api.deno.com/v1/organizations/${organizationId}/projects`,
  {
    method: "GET",
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
    },
  },
);

const response = await res.json();
console.log(response);
```
