Deno Deploy accounts are linked to GitHub accounts. You can only sign in to Deno
Deploy with GitHub authentication.

Your primary contact email address and name are synced from GitHub. Both your
username and email address update on every sign in. After changing your email,
login, or name on GitHub, sign in again to see these changes reflected in the
Deno Deploy dashboard.
