Deno Deploy supports logging in with GitHub.

Your primary contact email address and name are synced from GitHub. Both your
username and email address update on every sign in. After changing your email,
login, or name on GitHub, sign in again to see these changes reflected in the
Deno Deploy dashboard.

Deno also supports logging in with Google accounts.

Users authenticating with Deno Deploy using a Google account will also need to
provide GitHub credentials when creating new applications in order to access
GitHub repositories for deployments.
