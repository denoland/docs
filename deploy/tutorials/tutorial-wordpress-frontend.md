WordPress is the most popular CMS in the world, but is difficult to use in a
"headless" form, i.e. with a custom frontend.

In this tutorial, we show how to use Fresh, a modern web framework built on
Deno, to create a frontend for headless WordPress.

## Step 1: Clone the Fresh WordPress theme

Fresh offers two ready-to-go themes, one for a blog and one for shopfront.

### Blog

```bash
git clone https://github.com/denoland/fresh-wordpress-themes.git
cd fresh-wordpress-themes/blog
deno task docker
```

### Shop

```bash
git clone https://github.com/denoland/fresh-wordpress-themes.git
cd fresh-wordpress-themes/corporate
deno task docker
```

Note that Blog and Shop themes use different setups for WordPress server. Make
sure you run `deno task docker` command in the right directory.

## Step 2: Open another terminal in the same directory and run:

```sh
deno task start
```

## Step 3: Visit http://localhost:8000/

You can manage the contents of the site via the WordPress dashboard at
http://localhost/wp-admin (username: `user`, password: `password`).

## WordPress hosting options

There are a lot of options for hosting WordPress on the internet. Many cloud
providers
