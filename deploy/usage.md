Deno Deploy offers a generous free tier that allows you to run applications at
the edge with minimal cost. However, to ensure a fair and reliable service for
all users, there are certain usage guidelines and limitations in place. To
review the pricing details, please visit the
[Deno Deploy pricing page](https://deno.com/deploy/pricing).

If your application experiences a surprise traffic spike, we want to protect you
from an unexpectedly large bill. At the same time, we don't want to dampen your
success by automatically suspending traffic when limits are reached if that is
your preference.

Before October 1st 2025, you'll be able to configure alert thresholds and hard
spending limits directly from your organization dashboard. These controls, along
with timely notifications about your quota usage, will help protect you from
unexpected billing charges.

You’ll be able to review and control these in the
[Billing](https://console.deno.com/go/billing) section of your console.

The Deno company is now using Deno Deploy to host our own websites and is
putting significant efforts into ensuring service reliability.

to be in violation of the terms and conditions.
