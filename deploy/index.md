Deploy dashboard</a>

Deno Deploy comes with an easy to use dashboard at
[console.deno.com](https://console.deno.com). In this dashboard, you can create
new Deno Deploy organizations that contain Deno Deploy apps.

Within a single organization, you cannot mix Deno Deploy apps with Deploy
Classic projects. You can switch between different organizations using the
organization picker in the top left of the dashboard.

## What is Deno Deploy?

Deno Deploy is a serverless platform for running JavaScript and TypeScript
applications in the cloud (or self-hosted on your own infrastructure). It
provides a management plane for deploying and running applications with the
built-in CI or through integrations such as GitHub actions.

## Comparison to Deploy Classic

Deno Deploy is a complete rework of Deploy Classic. It has a new dashboard, and
a new execution environment that uses Deno 2.0 and is much more powerful than
Deploy Classic. The below table compares the two versions of Deno Deploy.
