:::info Legacy Documentation

You are viewing legacy documentation for Deno Deploy Classic. We recommend
migrating to the new
<a href="/deploy/early-access/">Deno Deploy<sup>EA</sup></a> platform.

:::

The simplest way to deploy more complex projects is via our Github integration.
This allows you to link a Deno Deploy Classic project to a GitHub repository.
Every time you push to the repository, your changes will be automatically
deployed.

Via the Github integration, you can add a Github Action that defines a build
step in your deployment process.

See [the Github integration page](ci_github) for more details.

### Deploy from command line with [`deployctl`](./deployctl.md)

`deployctl` is a command line tool for deploying your code to Deno Deploy. You
can control more details of your deployment than the above automatic GitHub
integration by using `deployctl`.

See [the `deployctl` page](./deployctl.md) for more details.

### Deploy with playground

The easiest way to deploy some code is via a Deno Deploy Classic playground.

See the [playground page](playgrounds) for more details.
