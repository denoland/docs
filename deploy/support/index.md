## Support tickets

When sending an email to support@deno.com, you will receive an automated reply
with a support ticket number, and a link to claim your ticket.

You can use this link to claim the ticket to your Deno Deploy account, allowing
you to track the status of your support request using the
[tickets dashboard](https://console.deno.com/tickets). This also allows our
support team to know which account you are contacting us from, so we can provide
better assistance.

You can see ticket status updates and respond to any questions from our support
team directly from the tickets dashboard. You will also receive email updates
when there are changes to your ticket, and you can reply to those emails to
provide additional information.

If you did not receive an automated reply, please check your spam or junk mail
folder.
