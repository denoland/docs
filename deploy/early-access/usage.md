As an early access product, Deno Deploy Early Access currently has a number of
limitations you should be aware of before using it:

- Deno Deploy Pro account features do not yet extend to Deno Deploy EA
- CLI deployment, and deployment from GitHub Actions are not yet available in
  Deno Deploy EA
- Database features such as Deno KV are not yet available in Deno Deploy EA
- Queues, and Cron are not available in Deno Deploy EA

:::info

Deno Deploy EA is an early access product, and as such is not currently covered
by our regular service level agreements.

:::

The Deno company is now using Deno Deploy EA to host our own websites, and are
putting significant efforts into avoiding any service interruptions, but as this
is a new system, minor service interruptions can not always be guaranteed.

While Deno Deploy EA is in closed beta, we are not charging for usage of the
platform. However, the
[Acceptable Use Policy](/deploy/manual/acceptable-use-policy/) and
[Terms and Conditions](/deploy/manual/terms-and-conditions/) still apply and we
reserve the right to terminate any user, organization, or app who we find to be
in violation of these.
