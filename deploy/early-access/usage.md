  Deno Deploy<sup>EA</sup>

Deno Deploy<sup>EA</sup> is an early access product, and as such is not
currently covered by our regular service level agreements.

:::

The Deno company is now using Deno Deploy<sup>EA</sup> to host our own websites,
and are putting significant efforts into avoiding any service interruptions, but
as this is a new system, minor service interruptions can not always be
guaranteed.

While Deno Deploy<sup>EA</sup> is in closed beta, we are not charging for usage
of the platform. However, the
[Acceptable Use Policy](/deploy/manual/acceptable-use-policy/) and
[Terms and Conditions](/deploy/manual/terms-and-conditions/) still apply and we
reserve the right to terminate any user, organization, or app who we find to be
in violation of these.
