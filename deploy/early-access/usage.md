As an early access product, Deno Deploy<sup>EA</sup> currently has a number of
limitations you should be aware of before using it:

- Deno Deploy Pro account features do not yet extend to Deno Deploy
  <sup>EA</sup>
- Queues and Cron are not available in Deno Deploy<sup>EA</sup>

:::info

Deno Deploy<sup>EA</sup> is an early access product, and as such is not
currently covered by our regular service level agreements.

:::

The Deno company is now using Deno Deploy<sup>EA</sup> to host our own websites
and is putting significant efforts into ensuring service reliability. However,
as this is a new system, occasional service interruptions may occur.

While Deno Deploy<sup>EA</sup> is still in early access, the
[Acceptable Use Policy](/deploy/manual/acceptable-use-policy/) and
[Terms and Conditions](/deploy/manual/terms-and-conditions/) still apply, and we
reserve the right to terminate any user, organization, or app that we find to be
in violation of these terms.
