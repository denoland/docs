description: "How to get support during the Deno Deploy Early Access phase, including Discord channels and email contact information."
---

During the early access phase you can get support either through
[the Deno Discord](https://discord.gg/deno), in the `#deploy-ea` channel, or
through email at [deploy@deno.com](mailto:deploy@deno.com). We are very
interested in a feedback you have, particularly what things went well and were
intuitive to you, and what pieces of the platform seem complicated or broken.
