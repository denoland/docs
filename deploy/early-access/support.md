description: "How to get support during the Deno Deploy Early Access phase, including Discord channels and email contact information."
---

During the early access phase you can get support either through Discord, in the
#deploy-ea channel, or through email at deploy@deno.com. We are very interested
in a feedback you have, particularly what things went well and were intuitive to
you, and what pieces of the platform seem complicated or broken.
