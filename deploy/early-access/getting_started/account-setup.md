# Setting Up Your Account

Before you can start using Deno Deploy Early Access, you need to set up your
account. This guide walks you through the process.

## Joining the Early Access Program

1. Visit the
   [Deploy Classic account settings page](https://dash.deno.com/account#early-access)
2. Sign in with your GitHub account if you haven't already
3. Click on "Join the Early Access Program" button
4. (Optional) Connect your Discord account to get access to the Early Access
   Discord channel

> **Note**: After joining the Early Access program, you may not immediately have
> access to Deno Deploy<sup>EA</sup> as we are rolling out access in waves.

## Accessing the Dashboard

Once you have been granted access to Deno Deploy<sup>EA</sup>:

1. Visit [app.deno.com](https://app.deno.com)
2. Sign in with the same GitHub account you used to join the Early Access
   program
3. You will be prompted to create a new organization or will see your existing
   Deno Deploy<sup>EA</sup> organizations

## GitHub Integration Setup

For the best experience with Deno Deploy<sup>EA</sup>, you should configure the
GitHub integration:

1. From the dashboard, click on the "Add another GitHub account" button
2. Authorize the Deno Deploy GitHub app for your personal account or
   organizations
3. Select the repositories you want to grant access to

This integration allows Deno Deploy<sup>EA</sup> to:

- Clone your repositories for deployment
- Set up webhooks for automatic deployments
- Access repository information for deployment configuration

## Understanding Account Limitations

During the Early Access phase:

- You must use GitHub authentication (no other login methods are supported)
- Your email address and username are synced from GitHub
- Changes to your GitHub profile (name, email) require re-login to be reflected
  in Deno Deploy<sup>EA</sup>

## Next Steps

Now that your account is set up, you can
[create your first organization](./create-organization).

For any issues with account setup, please [contact Deno support](../support).
