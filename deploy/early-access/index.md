:::info

You are viewing the documentation for Deploy Early Access. Looking for Deploy
Classic documentation? [View it here](/deploy/).

:::

Deno Deploy Early Access is a complete revamp of the original Deno Deploy,
featuring:

- Improved NPM compatibility and web framework support
- Built-in OpenTelemetry integration
- Integrated build system
- Significantly enhanced underlying infrastructure

<a href="https://app.deno.com" class="docs-cta runtime-cta">Try out Deploy Early
Access</a>

:::note

Deno Deploy EA is in private beta. To use Deno Deploy EA you must join the Early
Access program from the
[Deno Deploy Classic account settings page](https://dash.deno.com/account#early-access).

After joining the Early Access program, you may still not immediately have
access to Deno Deploy EA as we are rolling out access in waves.

:::

Deno Deploy EA comes with a new dashboard at
[app.deno.com](https://app.deno.com). In this dashboard, you can create new Deno
Deploy EA organizations that contain Deno Deploy EA apps. Note that within a
single organization, you cannot mix and match Deno Deploy EA apps and Deno
Deploy Classic projects. You can switch between Deno Deploy EA organizations and
Deno Deploy Classic organizations through the organization picker in the top
left of the dashboard.

## What is Deno Deploy EA?

Deno Deploy is a serverless platform for running JavaScript and TypeScript
applications in the cloud (or self-hosted on your own infrastructure). Deno
Deploy acts as a management plane for deploying and running applications, for
example through a GitHub integration.

## Comparison to Deno Deploy Classic

Deno Deploy EA is a complete rework of Deno Deploy Classic. It has a new
dashboard, and a new execution environment that uses Deno 2.0 and is much more
powerful than Deno Deploy Classic. The below table compares the two versions of
Deno Deploy.
