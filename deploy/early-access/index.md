:::info

You are viewing the documentation for Deno Deploy<sup>EA</sup>. Looking for
Deploy Classic documentation? [View it here](/deploy/).

:::

Deno Deploy Early Access (Deno Deploy<sup>EA</sup>) is a complete revamp of the
original Deploy, featuring:

- Improved NPM compatibility and web framework support
- Built-in OpenTelemetry integration
- Integrated build system
- Significantly enhanced underlying infrastructure

Deploy<sup>EA</sup></a>

:::note

Deno Deploy<sup>EA</sup> is in private beta. To use Deno Deploy
<sup>EA</sup> you must join the Early Access program from the
[Deploy Classic account settings page](https://dash.deno.com/account#early-access).

:::

Deno Deploy<sup>EA</sup> comes with a new dashboard at
[app.deno.com](https://app.deno.com). In this dashboard, you can create new Deno
Deploy<sup>EA</sup> organizations that contain Deno Deploy<sup>EA</sup> apps.

Within a single organization, you cannot mix and match Deno Deploy<sup>EA</sup>
apps and Deploy Classic projects. You can switch between Deno
Deploy<sup>EA</sup> organizations and Deploy Classic organizations through the
organization picker in the top left of the dashboard.

## What is Deno Deploy<sup>EA</sup>?

Deno Deploy is a serverless platform for running JavaScript and TypeScript
applications in the cloud (or self-hosted on your own infrastructure). Deno
Deploy acts as a management plane for deploying and running applications, for
example through a GitHub integration.

## Comparison to Deploy Classic

Deno Deploy<sup>EA</sup> is a complete rework of Deploy Classic. It has a new
dashboard, and a new execution environment that uses Deno 2.0 and is much more
powerful than Deploy Classic. The below table compares the two versions of Deno
Deploy.
