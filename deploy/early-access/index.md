You are viewing the documentation for Deploy Early Access. Looking for Deploy
Classic documentation? [View it here](/deploy/).

:::

Deno Deploy Early Access is a complete revamp of the original Deno Deploy,
featuring:

- Improved NPM compatibility and web framework support
- Built-in OpenTelemetry integration
- Integrated build system
- Significantly enhanced underlying infrastructure

Access</a>

Deno Deploy EA comes with a new dashboard at
[app.deno.com](https://app.deno.com). In this dashboard, you can create new Deno
Deploy EA organizations that contain Deno Deploy EA apps. Note that within a
single organization, you cannot mix and match Deno Deploy EA apps and Deno
Deploy Classic projects. You can switch between Deno Deploy EA organizations and
Deno Deploy Classic organizations through the organization picker in the top
left of the dashboard.
