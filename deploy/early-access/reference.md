## Account

The Deno Deploy EA account is the same as your Deno Deploy Classic account. At
this time you can only sign in through GitHub. Your primary contact email
address is copied from GitHub. Your name is also synced from GitHub.

Both username and email are synced from GitHub every time you log in. If you
have changed your name in GitHub, and do not see the change reflected on the
Deno Deploy dashboard, please sign-in again.

## Organizations

Organizations are groups of users that collectively own apps and domains. Upon
signing up to Deno Deploy EA, each user can either create an organization or be
invited to an existing organization by another Deno Deploy EA user.

Organizations have a name and a slug. The name is visible only to organization
members and appears in the organization dropdown in both Deno Deploy EA and Deno
Deploy Classic. The organization slug is used for the default domain of the
organization.

:::caution

Organizations cannot currently be renamed, nor can their slug be altered after
creation.

:::

Every organization has a default domain that is used for production, git branch,
and preview URLs for projects in that organization. For example, an org with the
slug `acme-inc` would have a default organization domain of `acme-inc.deno.net`.

At this time, organizations cannot be deleted.
