The Deploy Button offers a shortcut for users to create and deploy a new
application on Deno Deploy based on existing code hosted in a Git repository.

It provides a link directly into the Deno Deploy application creation flow, and
populates settings in the creation flow based on provided query parameters or
values found in the `deno.json` file of the specified source.

The specified repository will be cloned to the user’s GitHub account and set as
the source for a new project. By default, the new repository will be public, but
can be set to be private if required.

## Example

The deploy button below demonstrates the creation of a new application based on
a simple starter project

[![Deploy on Deno](https://deno.com/button)](https://app.deno.com/new?clone=https://github.com/denoland/examples&path=hello-world)

### Create and deploy a new application

Use the code below to give a button which creates and deploys a new application:

**Markdown**

```bash
[![Deploy on Deno](https://deno.com/button)](https://app.deno.com/new?clone=REPOSITORY_URL)
```

**HTML**

```bash
<a href="https://app.deno.com/new?clone=REPOSITORY_URL"><img src="https://deno.com/button" alt="Deploy on Deno"/></a>
```

**URL**

```bash
https://app.deno.com/new?clone=REPOSITORY_URL
```

- `clone` — (required) The URL of the source repo to clone as a new repo which
  will then be and then deploy
- `path` — (optional) The path within the source repo to clone from. Providing
