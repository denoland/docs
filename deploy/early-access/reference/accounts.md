Deno Deploy accounts are always associated with a GitHub account. It is only
possible to sign in to Deno Deploy using GitHub.

The primary contact email address and name are both synced from GitHub. Both
username and email address are updated on every sign in. After changing email,
login, or name in GitHub, you may need to sign in again to see the changes
reflected on the Deno Deploy dashboard.

Currently, only accounts that are part of the Early Access program can access
Deno Deploy<sup>EA</sup>. To join the Early Access program, visit the
[account settings in Deploy Classic](https://dash.deno.com/account#early-access)
and sign up. To get access to the Early Access Discord channel, connect your
Discord account to your Deno Deploy account via the same Early Access settings.
