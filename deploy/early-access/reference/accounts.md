You are viewing the documentation for Deno Deploy<sup>EA</sup>. Looking for
Deploy Classic documentation? [View it here](/deploy/).

:::

Deno Deploy accounts are linked to GitHub accounts. You can only sign in to Deno
Deploy using GitHub authentication.

Your primary contact email address and name are synced from GitHub. Both your
username and email address update on every sign in. After changing your email,
login, or name on GitHub, sign in again to see these changes reflected in the
Deno Deploy<sup>EA</sup> dashboard.

Currently, only accounts enrolled in the Early Access program can access Deno
Deploy<sup>EA</sup>. To join the program, visit the
[account settings in Deploy Classic](https://dash.deno.com/account#early-access)
and sign up. To access the Early Access Discord channel, connect your Discord
account to your Deno Deploy account through the same Early Access settings.
