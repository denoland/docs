Applications are web services that serve traffic within an organization. Each
application contains a history of revisions (previous versions), typically
corresponding to Git commits when using the GitHub integration.

Applications are identified by a slug, which must be unique within the
organization and is used in default domain names.

## Creating an application

To create an application:

1. Click the "+ Create App" button on the organization page
2. Select the GitHub repository to deploy from
3. Configure the app slug (name)
4. Set up build configuration
5. Add any required environment variables

> ⚠️ Currently, applications must be linked to a GitHub repository during
> creation.

The build configuration determines how the application is built during the
deployment process. Builds are automatically triggered on each push to the
linked repository or when manually clicking "Deploy Default Branch". For
detailed build configuration information, see the
[Builds documentation](/deploy/early-access/reference/builds/).

You can add environment variables during app creation by clicking "Edit
Environment Variables". For more details on environment variables, see the
[Environment Variables and Contexts](/deploy/early-access/reference/env-vars-and-contexts/)
documentation.

## Limitations

> ⚠️ Apps cannot currently be deleted.

> ⚠️ Apps cannot currently be renamed.

> ⚠️ Apps cannot currently be transferred to another organization.

## GitHub integration

The GitHub integration enables automatic deployments of the app from a GitHub
repository. Every push to the repository will trigger a new build of the app.
Depending on the branch of the commit, the build will be deployed to different
[timelines](/deploy/early-access/reference/timelines/).

Apps will generally be linked to a GitHub repository on creation. However, it is
possible to unlink the repository after creation, and optionally link it to a
new GitHub repository. This can be done from the app settings page.

Only accounts that have been authorized with the Deno Deploy GitHub app will be
visible in the GitHub repository dropdown. You can authorize new orgs or repos
by clicking the "+ Add another GitHub account" button in the user or
organization dropdown, or the "Configure GitHub app permissions" button in the
repository dropdown. This will redirect you to GitHub to authorize the Deno
Deploy GitHub app with the selected GitHub account or organization. After
authorizing, you will be redirected back to the app settings page, where you can
select the new GitHub repository.
