title: Frameworks

:::info

You are viewing the documentation for Deno Deploy<sup>EA</sup>. Looking for
Deploy Classic documentation? [View it here](/deploy/).

:::

Deno Deploy<sup>EA</sup> supports a number of JavaScript and TypeScript
frameworks out of the box. This means that you can use these frameworks without
any additional configuration or setup.

Natively supported frameworks are tested to work with Deno Deploy
<sup>EA</sup> and are automatically detected when you create a new app. Deno
Deploy<sup>EA</sup> automatically optimizes the build and runtime configuration
for these frameworks to be as optimal as possible.

Frameworks not listed here are still likely to work, but may require manually
configuring the install and/or build command and the runtime configuration in
the build settings.

Feel like a framework is missing? Let us know in the
[Deno Deploy Discord channel](https://discord.gg/deno) or
[contact Deno support](../support).

## Supported frameworks

### Next.js

Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. You use
React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features
and optimizations.

Both pages and app router are supported out of the box. ISR, SSG, SSR, and PPR
are supported. Caching is supported out of the box, including using the new
`"use cache"`.

`next/image` works out of the box.

Next.js on Deno Deploy<sup>EA</sup> always builds in standalone mode.

Tracing is supported out of the box, and Next.js automatically emits some spans
for incoming requests, routing, rendering, and other operations.

### Astro

Astro is a web framework for building content-driven websites like blogs,
marketing, and e-commerce. Astro leverages server rendering over client-side
rendering in the browser as much as possible.

For static Astro sites, no additional configuration is needed to use Deno Deploy
<sup>EA</sup>.

When using SSR in Astro with Deno Deploy
<sup>EA</sup>, you need to install the
[`@deno/astro-adapter`](https://github.com/denoland/deno-astro-adapter) package
and configure your `astro.config.mjs` file to use the adapter:

```bash
$ deno add npm:@deno/astro-adapter
# or npm install @deno/astro-adapter
# or yarn add @deno/astro-adapter
# or pnpm add @deno/astro-adapter
```

```diff title="astro.config.mjs"
  import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
+ import deno from '@deno/astro-adapter';
  
  export default defineConfig({
+   output: 'server',
+   adapter: deno(),
  });
```

Sharp image optimization is supported.

The `astro:env` API is supported.

### Nuxt

makes full-stack development with Vue.js intuitive.

Nuxt requires no additional setup.

### SolidStart

make up a web application. It is built on top of Solid.

SolidStart requires no additional setup.

### SvelteKit

### Lume

Deno.

Lume requires no additional setup.
