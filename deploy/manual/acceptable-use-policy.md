title: "Acceptable use policy"
---

The Deno Deploy service includes resources (CPU time, request counts) that are
subject to this Acceptable Use policy. This document can give a rough estimate
to what we consider as "Acceptable Use", and what we do not.

### Examples of Acceptable Use

- ✅ Server-side rendered websites
- ✅ Jamstack sites and apps
- ✅ Single page applications
- ✅ APIs that query a DB or external API
- ✅ A personal blog
- ✅ A company website
- ✅ An e-commerce site
- ✅ Reverse proxy

### Not Acceptable Use

- ❌ Crypto mining
- ❌ Highly CPU-intensive load (e.g. machine learning)
- ❌ Media hosting for external sites
- ❌ Scrapers
- ❌ Forward proxy
- ❌ VPN

## Guidelines

We expect most projects to fall well within the usage limits. We will notify you
if your projects usage significantly deviates from the norm. We will reach out
to you where possible before taking any action to address unreasonable burdens
on our infrastructure.
