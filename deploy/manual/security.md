title: "Security and responsible disclosure"

We consider the security of our systems, and all data controlled by those
systems a top priority. No matter how much effort we put into system security,
it is still possible that security vulnerabilities are present. We appreciate
investigative work into system security carried out by well-intentioned, ethical
security researchers. If you discover a vulnerability, however small, we would
like to know about it so we can address it with appropriate measures, as quickly
as possible. This page outlines the method we use to work with the security
research community to address our system security.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please email you findings to security@deno.com. We strive to resolve all
problems as quickly as possible, and are more than happy to play an active role
in publication of writeups after the problem is resolved.

## Please do the following:

- Do not take advantage of the vulnerability or problem you have discovered. For
  example only download data that is necessary to demonstrate the
  vulnerability - do not download any more. Also do not delete, modify, or view
  other people's data.
- Do not publish or reveal the problem until it has been resolved.
- Do not use attacks on physical security, social engineering, distributed
  denial of service, spam or applications of third parties.
- Do provide sufficient information to reproduce the problem, so we will be able
  to resolve it as quickly as possible. Usually, the IP address or the URL of
  the affected system and a description of the vulnerability will be sufficient,
  but complex vulnerabilities may require further explanation.

## Our commitment

- If you act in accordance with this policy, we will not take legal action
  against you in regard to your report.
- We will handle your report with strict confidentiality, and not pass on your
  personal details to third parties without your permission.
