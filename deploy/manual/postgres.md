title: "Connect to Postgres"
---

This tutorial covers how to connect to a Postgres database from an application
deployed on Deno Deploy.

You can find a more comprehensive tutorial that builds a sample application on
top of Postgres [here](../tutorials/tutorial-postgres).

## Setup Postgres

> This tutorial will focus entirely on connecting to Postgres unencrypted. If
> you would like to use encryption with a custom CA certificate, use the
> documentation [here](https://deno-postgres.com/#/?id=ssltls-connection).

To get started, we need to create a new Postgres instance for us to connect to.
For this tutorial, we will be using [Supabase](https://supabase.com) as they
provide free, managed Postgres instances. If you like to host your database
somewhere else, you can do that too.

1. Visit https://app.supabase.io/ and click **New project**.
2. Select a name, password, and region for your database. Make sure to save the
   password, as you will need it later.
3. Click **Create new project**. Creating the project can take a while, so be
   patient.

## Gather credentials from Postgres

Once you've set up your Postgres database, gather your connection information
from your Postgres instance.

### Supabase

For the Supabase instance above, to get your connection information:

1. Navigate to the **Database** tab on the left.
2. Go to the **Project Settings** >> **Database** and copy the connection string
   from the **Connection String** >> **URI** field. This is the connection
   string you will use to connect to your database. Insert the password you
   saved earlier into this string, and then save the string somewhere - you will
   need it later.

### psql

If you are using psql, you should generally be able to find your connection
information by running:

```psql
test=# \conninfo
```

Your Postgres connection string will take the form:

```sh
postgres://user:password@127.0.0.1:5432/deploy?sslmode=disable
```

## Create a project in Deno Deploy

Next, let's create a project in Deno Deploy and set it up with the requisite
environment variables:

1. Go to [https://dash.deno.com/new](https://dash.deno.com/new) (Sign in with
   GitHub if you didn't already) and click on **+ Empty Project** under **Deploy
   from the command line**.
2. Now click on the **Settings** button available on the project page.
3. Navigate to **Environment Variables** Section and add the following secrets.

- `DATABASE_URL` - The value should be your connection string that you retrieved
  in the last step.

## Write code that connects to Postgres

To read/write to Postgres, import the Postgres module, read the connection
string from the environment variables, and create a connection pool.

```ts
import { Pool } from "https://deno.land/x/postgres@v0.17.0/mod.ts";

// Get the connection string from the environment variable "DATABASE_URL"
const databaseUrl = Deno.env.get("DATABASE_URL")!;

// Create a database pool with three connections that are lazily established
const pool = new Pool(databaseUrl, 3, true);

// Connect to the database
const connection = await pool.connect();

try {
  // Create the table
  await connection.queryObject`
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS todos (
      id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      title TEXT NOT NULL
    )
  `;
} finally {
  // Release the connection back into the pool
  connection.release();
}
```

## Deploy application to Deno Deploy

Once you have finished writing your application, you can deploy it on Deno
Deploy.

To do this, go back to your project page at
`https://dash.deno.com/projects/<project-name>`.

You should see a couple of options to deploy:

- [Github integration](ci_github)
- [`deployctl`](./deployctl.md)
  ```sh
  deployctl deploy --project=<project-name> <application-file-name>
  ```

Unless you want to add a build step, we recommend that you select the Github
integration.

different configuration options, read [here](how-to-deploy).
