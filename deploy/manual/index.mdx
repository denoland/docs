# Deno Deploy Quick Start

Deno Deploy is a globally distributed platform for serverless JavaScript
applications. Your JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly code runs on managed
servers geographically close to your users, enabling low latency and faster
response times. Deploy applications run on fast, light-weight
[V8 isolates](https://deno.com/blog/anatomy-isolate-cloud) rather than virtual
machines, powered by the [Deno runtime](/runtime/manual).

Let's deploy your first application - it should only take a few minutes.

## Install Deno and `deployctl`

If you haven't already, you can
[install the Deno runtime](/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation)
using one of the commands below:

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS" default>

```sh
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh
```

</TabItem>
  <TabItem  value="windows" label="Windows">

```powershell
irm https://deno.land/install.ps1 | iex
```

</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

```sh
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

After Deno is installed, install the [`deployctl`](./deployctl.md) utility:

```
deno install -A jsr:@deno/deployctl
```

You can confirm `deployctl` has been installed correctly by running:

```console
deployctl --help
```

Now, you're ready to deploy a Deno script from the command line!

## Write and test a Deno program

First, create a directory for the project and create a file called `main.ts` in it, with the
following "Hello World" web server:

```ts title="main.ts"
Deno.serve(() => new Response("Hello, world!"));
```

You can test that it works by running it with the command below:

```
deno run --allow-net main.ts
```

Your server should be viewable at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
Now let's run this code on the edge with Deno Deploy!

## Deploy!

From the directory of the `main.ts` file you just created, run this command:

```sh
deployctl deploy
```

You will be asked to authorize Deno Deploy in GitHub to sign up to Deno Deploy and/or to provision
an access token for `deployctl`. A few moments after that, your Hello World server will be
deployed in Deno Deploy infrastructure all around the world, ready to handle all the traffic you expect.

## Next Steps

Now that you've created your first deployment, you can [learn what kinds of apps](./use-cases.md)
you can run on Deno Deploy, check out [what else you can do with deployctl](./deployctl.md), or keep
reading to find out what other options you have to deploy your code to Deno Deploy. We're so
excited to see what you'll ship with Deno Deploy!

### <a name="existingproject"></a>Deploy your existing project 

Import a project and run it on the edge it with Deno Deploy. 

1. [From the Deno Deploy dashboard](https://dash.deno.com) click the "New Project" button.

2. Connect to your GitHub account and select the repository you would like to deploy.

3. Follow the on-screen instructions to deploy your existing application. 

    If your project requires a build step, use the Project Configuration form to create a GitHub action to deploy your project. Give your project a name and select from the optional framework presets. If you are not using a framework, you can set up your build settings using the form.

4. Confirm that your build options are correct and click the "Deploy Project" button to kick off your new Github action and deploy your project.

In a few moments, your project will be deployed across ~12 data 
centers around the world, ready to handle large volumes of traffic. 

Once your deployment is successful you can visit your newly deployed project at the url provided on the success page or manage it in your dashboard.

### Start with a playground

A [playground](./playgrounds.md) is a browser-based editor that enables you to
write and run JavaScript or TypeScript code right away This is a great choice for just kicking the tires on Deno and Deno Deploy!

From the [Deno Deploy dashboard](https://dash.deno.com), click the "New Playground" button to create a playground. We also have a variety of ready built tutorials for you to try out Deno Deploy try them out by clicking on "Learning Playground" or visiting:\
[Simple HTTP server playground](https://dash.deno.com/tutorial/tutorial-http)\
[Using the Deno KV database playground](https://dash.deno.com/tutorial/tutorial-http-kv)\
