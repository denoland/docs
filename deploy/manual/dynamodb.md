title: "Connect to DynamoDB"
---

Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database. To persist data to DynamoDB,
follow the steps below:

The tutorial assumes that you have an AWS and Deno Deploy account.

You can find a more comprehensive tutorial that builds a sample application on
top of DynamoDB [here](../tutorials/tutorial-dynamodb).

## Gather credentials from DynamoDB

The first step in the process is to generate AWS credentials to programmatically
access DynamoDB.

Generate Credentials:

1. Go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/ and go to the "Users" section.
2. Click on the **Add user** button, fill the **User name** field (maybe use
   `denamo`), and select **Programmatic access** type.
3. Click on **Next: Permissions**, then on **Attach existing policies
   directly**, search for `AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess` and select it.
4. Click on **Next: Tags**, then on **Next: Review** and finally **Create
   user**.
5. Click on **Download .csv** button to download the credentials.

## Create a project in Deno Deploy

Next, let's create a project in Deno Deploy and set it up with the requisite
environment variables:

1. Go to [https://dash.deno.com/new](https://dash.deno.com/new) (Sign in with
   GitHub if you didn't already) and click on **+ Empty Project** under **Deploy
   from the command line**.
2. Now click on the **Settings** button available on the project page.
3. Navigate to **Environment Variables** Section and add the following secrets.

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - Use the value that's available under **Access key ID**
  column in the downloaded CSV.
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - Use the value that's available under **Secret access
  key** column in the downloaded CSV.

## Write code that connects to DynamoDB

AWS has an
[official SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb) that
works with browsers. As most Deno Deploy's APIs are similar to browsers', the
same SDK works with Deno Deploy. To use the SDK in Deno, import from a cdn like
below and create a client:

```js
import {
  DynamoDBClient,
  GetItemCommand,
  PutItemCommand,
} from "https://esm.sh/@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb?dts";

// Create a client instance by providing your region information.
// The credentials are automatically obtained from environment variables which
// we set during our project creation step on Deno Deploy, so we don't have to
// pass them manually here.
const client = new ApiFactory().makeNew(DynamoDB);

serve({
  "/songs": handleRequest,
});

async function handleRequest(request) {
  // async/await.
  try {
    const data = await client.send(command);
    // process data.
  } catch (error) {
    // error handling.
  } finally {
    // finally.
  }
}
```

## Deploy application to Deno Deploy

Once you have finished writing your application, you can deploy it on Deno
Deploy.

To do this, go back to your project page at
`https://dash.deno.com/projects/<project-name>`.

You should see a couple of options to deploy:

- [Github integration](ci_github)
- [`deployctl`](./deployctl.md)
  ```sh
  deployctl deploy --project=<project-name> <application-file-name>
  ```

Unless you want to add a build step, we recommend that you select the Github
integration.

For more details on the different ways to deploy on Deno Deploy and the
different configuration options, read [here](how-to-deploy).
