## Refund Policy

At Deno Deploy, we strive to provide exceptional service. If you are not
satisfied with our service, you may request a refund under the following
conditions:

A refund must be requested within 14 days of the initial purchase or upgrade of
any subscription plan. Refunds may be considered if the service fails to
function correctly and if the issue cannot be resolved by our support team
within a reasonable time frame. No refunds will be issued for services used in
violation of our terms of service or for problems clearly attributable to user
error or external platform changes. Recurring subscriptions may be canceled but
are only eligible for a refund for the initial billing cycle if requested within
the 14-day period.

## Cancellation Policy

You can cancel your Deno Deploy subscription at any time under the following
terms:

Subscription cancellations are effective immediately, and the service will
continue to run until the end of the current billing period. To cancel your
subscription, please navigate to your account settings on the Deno Deploy
dashboard and select 'Cancel Subscription'. Once the subscription is canceled,
no further charges will be incurred, but you are responsible for any charges
accrued before the effective date of cancellation. Contact Us For more
information about our fulfillment policies, or if you require assistance, please
