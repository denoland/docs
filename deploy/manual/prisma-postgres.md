title: "Connect to Prisma Postgres"
---

This tutorial covers how to connect to a Prisma Postgres database from an
application deployed on Deno Deploy.

You can find a more comprehensive tutorial that builds a sample application on
top of Postgres [here](../tutorials/tutorial-postgres).

## Setup Postgres

There are several ways to set up a Prisma Postgre database for your Prisma
project. This guide covers the most common approaches.

### Method 1: Using Prisma CLI

Run the following command to initialize a new Prisma project with a database:

```bash
npx prisma init --db
```

This will prompt you to select your preferred region and database name. Once
completed, you'll find the `DATABASE_URL` connection string in your `.env` file.

### Method 2: Using `npx create-db`

Alternatively, you can use the dedicated database creation tool:

```bash
npx create-db@latest
```

This command will provide you with two connection strings tied to the same
database:

**Prisma ORM optimized connection string:**

```txt
prisma+postgres://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=<api_key>
```

**Standard Prisma Postgres connection string:**

```txt
postgresql://<username>:<password>@db.prisma.io:5432/postgres
```

In order to keep the database created with `npx create-db`, you must follow
through with the claim process. That can be done via the claim link provided in
the terminal.

The Prisma ORM optimized connection string (`prisma+postgres://`) only works
with the Prisma ORM, while the standard Prisma Postgre connection string can be
used with other database tools and libraries.

## Create a project in Deno Deploy

Next, let's create a project in Deno Deploy and set it up with the requisite
environment variables:

1. Go to [https://dash.deno.com/new](https://dash.deno.com/new) (Sign in with
   GitHub if you didn't already) and click on **Create an empty project** under
   **Deploy your own code**.
2. Now click on the **Settings** button available on the project page.
3. Navigate to **Environment Variables** Section and add the following secret.

- `DATABASE_URL` - The value should be set to the connection string you saved in
  the last step.

## Write code that connects to Postgres

Now that you have your database set up, let's create a simple application that
connects to the Prisma Postgres database using Prisma ORM.

### 1. Install dependencies

First, install the required dependencies:

```bash
deno install npm:@prisma/client
deno install npm:@prisma/extension-accelerate
deno install npm:dotenv-cli
```

:::note

The `dotenv-cli` package is needed because Prisma Client doesn't read `.env`
files by default on Deno.

:::

### 2. Create the database schema

With your database connection configured, you can now apply the data model to
your database:

```bash
deno run -A npm:prisma migrate dev --name init
```

This command creates a new SQL migration file and runs it against your database.

### 3. Update your Prisma schema

Edit your `prisma/schema.prisma` file to define a `Log` model and configure it
for Deno:

```ts
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client"
  output   = "../generated/prisma"
  runtime  = "deno"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model Log {
  id      Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  level   Level
  message String
  meta    Json
}

enum Level {
  Info
  Warn
  Error
}
```

### 4. Create your application

Create `index.ts` in your project root with the following content:

```typescript
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.140.0/http/server.ts";
import { withAccelerate } from "npm:@prisma/extension-accelerate";
import { PrismaClient } from "./generated/prisma/client.ts";

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(withAccelerate());

async function handler(request: Request) {
  // Ignore /favicon.ico requests:
  const url = new URL(request.url);
  if (url.pathname === "/favicon.ico") {
    return new Response(null, { status: 204 });
  }

  const log = await prisma.log.create({
    data: {
      level: "Info",
      message: `${request.method} ${request.url}`,
      meta: {
        headers: JSON.stringify(request.headers),
      },
    },
  });
  const body = JSON.stringify(log, null, 2);
  return new Response(body, {
    headers: { "content-type": "application/json; charset=utf-8" },
  });
}

serve(handler);
```

### 4. Test your application locally

Start your application locally to test the database connection:

```bash
npx dotenv -- deno run -A ./index.ts
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser. Each request will create a new
log entry in your database and return the log data as JSON.

## Deploy application to Deno Deploy

Once you have finished writing your application, you can deploy it on Deno
Deploy.

To do this, go back to your project page at
`https://dash.deno.com/projects/<project-name>`.

You should see a couple of options to deploy:

- [Github integration](ci_github)
- [`deployctl`](./deployctl.md)
  ```sh
  deployctl deploy --project=<project-name> <application-file-name>
  ```

Unless you want to add a build step, we recommend that you select the GitHub
integration.

different configuration options, read [here](how-to-deploy).
