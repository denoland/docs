You can also build and install from source using
[Cargo](https://crates.io/crates/deno):

```shell
cargo install deno --locked
```

Deno binaries can also be installed manually, by downloading a zip file at
[github.com/denoland/deno/releases](https://github.com/denoland/deno/releases).
These packages contain just a single executable file. You will have to set the
executable bit on macOS and Linux.

## Docker

For more information and instructions on the official Docker images:
[https://github.com/denoland/deno_docker](https://github.com/denoland/deno_docker)

## Testing your installation

To test your installation, run `deno --version`. If this prints the Deno version
to the console the installation was successful.

Use `deno help` to see help text documenting Deno's flags and usage. Get a
detailed guide on the CLI
[here](/runtime/getting_started/command_line_interface/).

## Updating

To update a previously installed version of Deno, you can run:

```shell
deno upgrade
```

Or using [Winget](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli) (Windows):

```shell
winget upgrade DenoLand.Deno
```

This will fetch the latest release from
[github.com/denoland/deno/releases](https://github.com/denoland/deno/releases),
unzip it, and replace your current executable with it.

You can also use this utility to install a specific version of Deno:

```shell
deno upgrade --version 1.0.1
```

## Building from source

Information about how to build from source can be found in the
[`Contributing`](/runtime/contributing/building_from_source/) chapter.
