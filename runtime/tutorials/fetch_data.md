Deno brings several familiar Web APIs to the server-side environment. If you've
worked with browsers you may recognize the [`fetch()`](/api/web/fetch) method
and the [`streams`](/api/web/streams) API, which are used to make network
requests and access streams of data over the network. Deno implements these
APIs, allowing you to fetch and stream data from the web.

## Fetching data

When building a web application, developers will often need to retrieve
resources from somewhere else on the web. We can do so with the `fetch` API.
We'll look at how to fetch different shapes of data from a url and how to handle
an error if the request fails.

Create a new file called `fetch.js` and add the following code:

```ts title="fetch.js"
// Output: JSON Data
const jsonResponse = await fetch("https://api.github.com/users/denoland");
const jsonData = await jsonResponse.json();

console.log(jsonData, "\n");

// Output: HTML Data
const textResponse = await fetch("https://deno.land/");
const textData = await textResponse.text();

console.log(textData, "\n");

// Output: Error Message
try {
  await fetch("https://does.not.exist/");
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error);
}
```

You can run this code with the `deno run` command. Because it is fetching data
across the network, you need to grant the `--allow-net` permission:

```sh
deno run --allow-net fetch.js
```

You should see the JSON data, HTML data as text, and an error message in the
console.

## Streaming data

Sometimes you may want to send or receive large files over the network. When you
don't know the size of a file in advance, streaming is a more efficient way to
handle the data. The client can read from the stream until it says it is done.

Deno provides a way to stream data using the `Streams API`. We'll look at how to
convert a file into a readable or writable stream and how to send and receive
files using streams.

Create a new file called `stream.js`.

We'll use the `fetch` API to retrieve a file. Then we'll use the
[`Deno.open`](/api/deno/Deno.open) method to create and open a writable file and
the [`pipeTo`](/api/web/~/ReadableStream.pipeTo) method from the Streams API to
send the byte stream to the created file.

Next, we'll use the `readable` property on a `POST` request to send the bite
stream of the file to a server.

```ts title="stream.js"
// Receiving a file
const fileResponse = await fetch("https://deno.land/logo.svg");

if (fileResponse.body) {
  const file = await Deno.open("./logo.svg", { write: true, create: true });

  await fileResponse.body.pipeTo(file.writable);
}

// Sending a file
const file = await Deno.open("./logo.svg", { read: true });

await fetch("https://example.com/", {
  method: "POST",
  body: file.readable,
});
```

You can run this code with the `deno run` command. Because it is fetching data
across the network and writing to a file, you need to grant the `--allow-net`,
`--allow-write` and `--allow-read` permissions:

```sh
deno run --allow-read --allow-write --allow-net stream.js
```

You should see the file `logo.svg` created and populated in the current
directory and, if you owned example.com you would see the file being sent to the
server.

ðŸ¦• Now you know how to fetch and stream data across a network and how to stream
that data to and from files! Whether you're serving static files, processing
uploads, generating dynamic content or streaming large datasets, Denoâ€™s file
handling and streaming capabilities are great tools to have in your developer
toolbox!
