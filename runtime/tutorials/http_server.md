An HTTP server is a software application that serves content over the web. It
listens for incoming requests from clients (like web browsers) and sends back
responses. HTTP servers are the backbone of the web, allowing you to access
websites, download files, and interact with web services. In simple terms, HTTP
servers deliver the content you see in your browser.

When you build your own HTTP server, you have complete control over its behavior
and can tailor it to your specific needs. You may be using it for local
development, to serve your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, or perhaps you're
building a REST API - having your own server lets you define endpoints, handle
requests and manage data.

Deno offers multiple ways to create an HTTP server. In this tutorial, we'll look
at some of the most common methods.

## Deno.serve

The simplest way to create an HTTP server in Deno is by using `Deno.serve`.

We'll set up a basic HTTP server that responds to requests with the
[user-agent information](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent).
When you access the server at http://localhost:8080/, it will display the
user-agent string from your browser or client.

Create a new file called `server.ts` and add the following code:

```ts title="server.ts"
const port = 8080;

const handler = (request: Request): Response => {
  const body = `Your user-agent is:\n\n${
    request.headers.get("user-agent") ?? "Unknown"
  }`;

  return new Response(body, { status: 200 });
};

console.log(`HTTP server running. Access it at: http://localhost:${port}/`);
Deno.serve({ port }, handler);
```

This code defines a function called `handler` that takes a `Request` object and
returns a `Response` object. The `handler` function extracts the user-agent
string from the request headers and sends it back as the response body.

The `Deno.serve` function creates an HTTP server that listens on the suggested
`port` and uses the `handler` function to process incoming requests.

You can run this code with:

```sh
deno run --allow-net server.ts
```

The server will start and display a message in the console. Open your browser
and navigate to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to see the
user-agent information.

The [`--allow-net` flag](/runtime/fundamentals/security/) is required to allow
the server to listen for incoming requests. This flag grants Deno permissions to
access the network.

## Default fetch export

Another way to create an HTTP server in Deno is by exporting a default `fetch`
function. [The fetch API](/api/web/~/fetch) initiates an HTTP request to
retrieve data from across a network and is built into the Deno runtime.

Create a new file called `server.ts` and add the following code:

```ts title="server.ts"
export default {
  fetch(request) {
    const userAgent = request.headers.get("user-agent") || "Unknown";
    return new Response(`User Agent: ${userAgent}`);
  },
} satisfies Deno.ServeDefaultExport;
```

You can run this file with the `deno serve` command:

```sh
deno serve server.ts
```

The server will start and display a message in the console. Open your browser
and navigate to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) to see the
user-agent information.

## Building on these examples

You will likely want to expand on these examples to create more complex servers.
Deno recommends using the [Oak](https://jsr.io/@oak/oak) middleware framework
for building web servers. Oak is a middleware framework for Deno's HTTP server,
designed to be expressive and easy to use. It provides a simple way to create
web servers with middleware support. Check out the
[Oak documentation](https://oakserver.github.io/oak/) for examples of how to
define routes.

ðŸ¦• Now you can create your own HTTP server! You've learned how to set up a
server, handle requests, and respond to clients. Now you have the basis to start
building APIs, serving static files, or experimenting with server-side code.
