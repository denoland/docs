title: "Build a Next.js App"
---

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a popular framework for building
server-side-rendered applications. It is built on top of React and provides a
lot of features out of the box.

In this tutorial, we'll build a simple Next.js application and run it with Deno.
The app will display a list of dinosaurs. When you click on one, it'll take you
to a dinosaur page with more details.

![demo of the app](../images/how-to/next/dinoapp.gif)

Start by verifying that you have the latest version of Deno installed, you will
need at least Deno 1.46.0:

```sh
deno --version
```

## Create a Next.js app with Deno

Next provides a CLI tool to quickly scaffold a new Next.js app. In your terminal
run the following command to create a new Next.js app with Deno:

```sh
deno run -A npm:create-next-app@latest
```

When prompted, select the default options to create a new Next.js app with
TypeScript.

Then, `cd` into the newly created project folder and run the following command
to serve your new Next.js app:

```sh
deno task dev
```

This will start the Next.js server, click the output link to localhost to see
your app in the browser.

## Add a backend

The next step is to add a backend API. We'll create a very simple API that
returns information about dinosaurs.

We'll use Next.js's
[built in API route handlers](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers)
to set up our dinosaur API. Next.js uses a file-system-based router, where the
folder structure directly defines the routes.

We'll define three routes, The first route at `/api` will return the string
`Welcome to the dinosaur API`, then we'll set up `/api/dinosaurs` to return all
the dinosaurs, and finally `/api/dinosaur/[dinosaur]` to return a specific
dinosaur based on the name in the URL.

### /api/

In the `app` folder of your new project, create an `api` folder. In that folder,
create a `route.ts` file, which will handle requests to `/api/.

Copy and paste the following code into the `api/route.ts` file:

```ts title="route.ts"
export async function GET() {
  return Response.json("welcome to the dinosaur API");
}
```

This code defines a simple route handler that returns a JSON response with the
string `welcome to the dinosaur API`.

### /api/dinosaurs

In the `api` folder, create a folder called `dinosaurs`. In that folder, make a
`data.json` file, which will contain the hard coded dinosaur data. Copy and
paste
[this json file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denoland/deno-vue-example/main/api/data.json)
into the `data.json` file.

Create a `route.ts` file in the `dinosaurs` directory, which will handle
requests to `/api/dinosaurs`. In this route we'll read the `data.json` file and
return the dinosaurs as JSON:

```ts title="route.ts"
import data from "./data.json" with { type: "json" };

export async function GET() {
  return Response.json(data);
}
```

### /api/dinosaurs/[dinosaur]

And for the final route, `/api/dinosaurs/[dinosaur]`, we'll create a folder
called `[dinosaur]` in the `dinosaurs` directory. In there, create a `route.ts`
file. In this file we'll read the `data.json` file, find the dinosaur with the
name in the URL, and return it as JSON:

```ts title="route.ts"
import { NextRequest } from "next/server";
import data from "../data.json" with { type: "json" };

type RouteParams = { params: Promise<{ dinosaur: string }> };

export const GET = async (request: NextRequest, { params }: RouteParams) => {
  const { dinosaur } = await params;

  if (!dinosaur) {
    return Response.json("No dinosaur name provided.");
  }

  const dinosaurData = data.find((item) =>
    item.name.toLowerCase() === context.params.dinosaur.toLowerCase()
  );

  return Response.json(dinosaurData ? dinosaurData : "No dinosaur found.");
};
```

Now, if you run the app with `deno task dev` and visit
`http://localhost:3000/api/dinosaurs/brachiosaurus` in your browser, you should
see the details of the brachiosaurus dinosaur.

## Build the frontend

Now that we have our backend API set up, let's build the frontend to display the
dinosaur data.

### Define the dinosaur type

Firstly we'll set up a new type, to define the shape of the dinosaur data. In
the `app` directory, create a `types.ts` file and add the following code:

```ts title="types.ts"
export type Dino = { name: string; description: string };
```

### Update the homepage

We'll update the `page.tsx` file in the `app` directory to fetch the dinosaur
data from our API and display it as a list of links.

To execute client-side code in Next.js we need to use the `use Client` directive
at the top of the file. Then we'll import the modules that we'll need in this
page and export the default function that will render the page:

```tsx title="page.tsx"
"use client";

import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { Dino } from "./types";
import Link from "next/link";

export default function Home() {
}
```

Inside the body of the `Home` function, we'll define a state variable to store
the dinosaur data, and a `useEffect` hook to fetch the data from the API when
the component mounts:

```tsx title="page.tsx"
const [dinosaurs, setDinosaurs] = useState<Dino[]>([]);

useEffect(() => {
  (async () => {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/dinosaurs`);
    const allDinosaurs = await response.json() as Dino[];
    setDinosaurs(allDinosaurs);
  })();
}, []);
```

Beneath this, still inside the body of the `Home` function, we'll return a list
of links, each linking to the dinosaur's page:

```tsx title="page.tsx"
return (
  <main>
    <h1>Welcome to the Dinosaur app</h1>
    <p>Click on a dinosaur below to learn more.</p>
    <ul>
      {dinosaurs.map((dinosaur: Dino) => {
        return (
          <li key={dinosaur.name}>
            <Link href={`/${dinosaur.name.toLowerCase()}`}>
              {dinosaur.name}
            </Link>
          </li>
        );
      })}
    </ul>
  </main>
);
```

### Create the dinosaur page

Inside the `app` directory, create a new folder called `[dinosaur]`. Inside this
folder create a `page.tsx` file. This file will fetch the details of a specific
dinosaur from the API and render them on the page.

Much like the homepage, we'll need client side code, and we'll import the
modules we need and export a default function. We'll pass the incoming to the
function and set up a type for this parameter:

```tsx title="[dinosaur]/page.tsx"
"use client";

import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { Dino } from "../types";
import Link from "next/link";

type RouteParams = { params: Promise<{ dinosaur: string }> };

export default function Dinosaur({ params }: RouteParams) {
}
```

Inside the body of the `Dinosaur` function we'll get the selected dinosaur from
the request, set up a state variable to store the dinosaur data, and write a
`useEffect` hook to fetch the data from the API when the component mounts:

```tsx title="[dinosaur]/page.tsx"
const selectedDinosaur = params.then((params) => params.dinosaur);
const [dinosaur, setDino] = useState<Dino>({ name: "", description: "" });

useEffect(() => {
  (async () => {
    const resp = await fetch(`/api/dinosaurs/${await selectedDinosaur}`);
    const dino = await resp.json() as Dino;
    setDino(dino);
  })();
}, []);
```

Finally, still inside the `Dinosaur` function body, we'll return a paragraph
element containing the dinosaur's name and description:

```tsx title="[dinosaur]/page.tsx"
return (
  <main>
    <h1>{dinosaur.name}</h1>
    <p>{dinosaur.description}</p>
    <Link href="/">ðŸ   Back to all dinosaurs</Link>
  </main>
);
```

## Run the app

Now you can run the app with `deno task dev` and visit `http://localhost:3000`
in your browser to see the list of dinosaurs. Click on a dinosaur to see more
details!

ðŸ¦• Now you can build and run a Next.js app with Deno! To build on your app you
could consider [adding a database](/runtime/tutorials/connecting_to_databases/)
to replace your `data.json` file, or consider
[writing some tests](/runtime/fundamentals/testing/) to make your app reliable
and production ready.
