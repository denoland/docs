[Deno by Example](/examples/) is a collection of examples that demonstrate how
to use Deno and its APIs. If you contribute an example, we'll send you a free
pack of stickers!

## Contributing an example

If you have a Deno example that you would like to share with the community, you
can contribute it to the
[Deno docs repository](https://github.com/denoland/docs?tab=readme-ov-file#examples)
or make an issue if there's an example you'd like to see. If your example is
merged, we'll credit you as the author and send you some awesome special edition
Deno stickers so that you can show off your contributor status as a token of our
appreciation.

## Getting your stickers

If you've contributed an example, drop us an email at
[docs@deno.com](mailto:docs@deno.com) and let us know so we can get your
stickers out to you!
