:::note

Note that this is the style guide for **internal runtime code** in the Deno
runtime, and in the Deno Standard Library. This is not meant as a general style
guide for users of Deno.

:::

### Copyright Headers

Most modules in the repository should have the following copyright header:

```ts
// Copyright 2018-2024 the Deno authors. All rights reserved. MIT license.
```

If the code originates elsewhere, ensure that the file has the proper copyright
headers. We only allow MIT, BSD, and Apache licensed code.

### Use underscores, not dashes in filenames

Example: Use `file_server.ts` instead of `file-server.ts`.

### Add tests for new features

Each module should contain or be accompanied by tests for its public
functionality.

### TODO Comments

TODO comments should usually include an issue or the author's github username in
parentheses. Example:

```ts
// TODO(ry): Add tests.
// TODO(#123): Support Windows.
// FIXME(#349): Sometimes panics.
```

### Meta-programming is discouraged. Including the use of Proxy

Be explicit, even when it means more code.

There are some situations where it may make sense to use such techniques, but in
the vast majority of cases it does not.

### Inclusive code

Please follow the guidelines for inclusive code outlined at
https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/HEAD/styleguide/inclusive_code.md.

### Rust

Follow Rust conventions and be consistent with existing code.

### TypeScript

The TypeScript portion of the code base is the standard library `std`.

#### Use TypeScript instead of JavaScript

#### Do not use the filename `index.ts`/`index.js`

Deno does not treat "index.js" or "index.ts" in a special way. By using these
filenames, it suggests that they can be left out of the module specifier when
they cannot. This is confusing.

If a directory of code needs a default entry point, use the filename `mod.ts`.
The filename `mod.ts` follows Rust's convention, is shorter than `index.ts`, and
doesn't come with any preconceived notions about how it might work.

#### Exported functions: max 2 args, put the rest into an options object

When designing function interfaces, stick to the following rules.

1. A function that is part of the public API takes 0-2 required arguments, plus
   (if necessary) an options object (so max 3 total).

2. Optional parameters should generally go into the options object.

   An optional parameter that's not in an options object might be acceptable if
   there is only one, and it seems inconceivable that we would add more optional
   parameters in the future.

3. The 'options' argument is the only argument that is a regular 'Object'.

   Other arguments can be objects, but they must be distinguishable from a
   'plain' Object runtime, by having either:

   - a distinguishing prototype (e.g. `Array`, `Map`, `Date`, `class MyThing`).
   - a well-known symbol property (e.g. an iterable with `Symbol.iterator`).

   This allows the API to evolve in a backwards compatible way, even when the
   position of the options object changes.

```ts
// BAD: optional parameters not part of options object. (#2)
export function resolve(
  hostname: string,
  family?: "ipv4" | "ipv6",
  timeout?: number,
): IPAddress[] {}
```

```ts
// GOOD.
export interface ResolveOptions {
  family?: "ipv4" | "ipv6";
  timeout?: number;
}
export function resolve(
  hostname: string,
  options: ResolveOptions = {},
): IPAddress[] {}
```

```ts
export interface Environment {
  [key: string]: string;
}

// BAD: `env` could be a regular Object and is therefore indistinguishable
// from an options object. (#3)
export function runShellWithEnv(cmdline: string, env: Environment): string {}

// GOOD.
export interface RunShellOptions {
  env: Environment;
}
export function runShellWithEnv(
  cmdline: string,
  options: RunShellOptions,
): string {}
```

```ts
// BAD: more than 3 arguments (#1), multiple optional parameters (#2).
export function renameSync(
  oldname: string,
  newname: string,
  replaceExisting?: boolean,
  followLinks?: boolean,
) {}
```

```ts
// GOOD.
interface RenameOptions {
  replaceExisting?: boolean;
  followLinks?: boolean;
}
export function renameSync(
  oldname: string,
  newname: string,
  options: RenameOptions = {},
) {}
```

```ts
// BAD: too many arguments. (#1)
export function pwrite(
  fd: number,
  buffer: ArrayBuffer,
  offset: number,
  length: number,
  position: number,
) {}
```

```ts
// BETTER.
export interface PWrite {
  fd: number;
  buffer: ArrayBuffer;
  offset: number;
  length: number;
  position: number;
}
export function pwrite(options: PWrite) {}
```

Note: When one of the arguments is a function, you can adjust the order
flexibly. See examples like
[Deno.serve](https://docs.deno.com/api/deno/~/Deno.serve),
[Deno.test](https://docs.deno.com/api/deno/~/Deno.test),
[Deno.addSignalListener](https://docs.deno.com/api/deno/~/Deno.addSignalListener).

#### Export all interfaces that are used as parameters to an exported member

Whenever you are using interfaces that are included in the parameters or return
type of an exported member, you should export the interface that is used. Here
is an example:

```ts
// my_file.ts
export interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

export function createPerson(name: string, age: number): Person {
  return { name, age };
}

// mod.ts
export { createPerson } from "./my_file.ts";
export type { Person } from "./my_file.ts";
```

#### Minimize dependencies; do not make circular imports

Although `std` has no external dependencies, we must still be careful to keep
internal dependencies simple and manageable. In particular, be careful not to
introduce circular imports.

#### If a filename starts with an underscore: `_foo.ts`, do not link to it

There may be situations where an internal module is necessary but its API is not
meant to be stable or linked to. In this case prefix it with an underscore. By
convention, only files in its own directory should import it.

#### Use JSDoc for exported symbols

We strive for complete documentation. Every exported symbol ideally should have
a documentation line.

If possible, use a single line for the JSDoc. Example:

```ts
/** foo does bar. */
export function foo() {
  // ...
}
```

It is important that documentation is easily human-readable, but there is also a
need to provide additional styling information to ensure generated documentation
is more rich text. Therefore JSDoc should generally follow markdown markup to
enrich the text.

While markdown supports HTML tags, it is forbidden in JSDoc blocks.

Code string literals should be braced with the back-tick (\`) instead of quotes.
For example:

```ts
/** Import something from the `deno` module. */
```

Do not document function arguments unless they are non-obvious of their intent
(though if they are non-obvious intent, the API should be considered anyways).
Therefore `@param` should generally not be used. If `@param` is used, it should
not include the `type` as TypeScript is already strongly-typed.

```ts
/**
 * Function with non-obvious param.
 * @param foo Description of non-obvious parameter.
 */
```

Vertical spacing should be minimized whenever possible. Therefore, single-line
comments should be written as:

```ts
/** This is a good single-line JSDoc. */
```

And not:

```ts
/**
 * This is a bad single-line JSDoc.
 */
```

Code examples should utilize markdown format, like so:

````ts
/** A straightforward comment and an example:
 * ```ts
 * import { foo } from "deno";
 * foo("bar");
 * ```
 */
````

Code examples should not contain additional comments and must not be indented.
It is already inside a comment. If it needs further comments, it is not a good
example.

#### Resolve linting problems using directives

Currently, the building process uses `dlint` to validate linting problems in the
code. If the task requires code that is non-conformant to linter use
`deno-lint-ignore <code>` directive to suppress the warning.

```typescript
// deno-lint-ignore no-explicit-any
let x: any;
```

This ensures the continuous integration process doesn't fail due to linting
problems, but it should be used scarcely.

#### Each module should come with a test module

Every module with public functionality `foo.ts` should come with a test module
`foo_test.ts`. A test for a `std` module should go in `std/tests` due to their
different contexts; otherwise, it should just be a sibling to the tested module.

#### Unit Tests should be explicit

For a better understanding of the tests, function should be correctly named as
it's prompted throughout the test command. Like:

```console
foo() returns bar object ... ok
```

Example of test:

```ts
import { assertEquals } from "@std/assert";
import { foo } from "./mod.ts";

Deno.test("foo() returns bar object", function () {
  assertEquals(foo(), { bar: "bar" });
});
```

Note: See [tracking issue](https://github.com/denoland/deno_std/issues/3754) for
more information.

#### Top-level functions should not use arrow syntax

Top-level functions should use the `function` keyword. Arrow syntax should be
limited to closures.

Bad:

```ts
export const foo = (): string => {
  return "bar";
};
```

Good:

```ts
export function foo(): string {
  return "bar";
}
```

#### Error Messages

User-facing error messages raised from JavaScript / TypeScript should be clear,
concise, and consistent. Error messages should be in sentence case but should
not end with a period. Error messages should be free of grammatical errors and
typos and written in American English.

:::note

Note that the error message style guide is a work in progress, and not all the
error messages have been updated to conform to the current styles.

:::

Error message styles that should be followed:

1. Messages should start with an upper case:

```sh
Bad: cannot parse input
Good: Cannot parse input
```

2. Messages should not end with a period:

```sh
Bad: Cannot parse input.
Good: Cannot parse input
```

3. Message should use quotes for values for strings:

```sh
Bad: Cannot parse input hello, world
Good: Cannot parse input "hello, world"
```

4. Message should state the action that lead to the error:

```sh
Bad: Invalid input x
Good: Cannot parse input x
```

5. Active voice should be used:

```sh
Bad: Input x cannot be parsed
Good: Cannot parse input x
```

6. Messages should not use contractions:

```sh
Bad: Can't parse input x
Good: Cannot parse input x
```

7. Messages should use a colon when providing additional information. Periods
   should never be used. Other punctuation may be used as needed:

```sh
Bad: Cannot parse input x. value is empty
Good: Cannot parse input x: value is empty
```

8. Additional information should describe the current state, if possible, it
   should also describe the desired state in an affirmative voice:

```sh
Bad: Cannot compute the square root for x: value must not be negative
Good: Cannot compute the square root for x: current value is ${x}
Better: Cannot compute the square root for x as x must be >= 0: current value is ${x}
```

### std

#### Do not depend on external code.

`https://jsr.io/@std` is intended to be baseline functionality that all Deno
programs can rely on. We want to guarantee to users that this code does not
include potentially unreviewed third-party code.

#### Document and maintain browser compatibility.

If a module is browser-compatible, include the following in the JSDoc at the top
of the module:

```ts
// This module is browser-compatible.
```

Maintain browser compatibility for such a module by either not using the global
`Deno` namespace or feature-testing for it. Make sure any new dependencies are
also browser compatible.

#### Prefer # over private keyword

We prefer the private fields (`#`) syntax over `private` keyword of TypeScript
in the standard modules codebase. The private fields make the properties and
methods private even at runtime. On the other hand, `private` keyword of
TypeScript guarantee it private only at compile time and the fields are publicly
accessible at runtime.

Good:

```ts
class MyClass {
  #foo = 1;
  #bar() {}
}
```

Bad:

```ts
class MyClass {
  private foo = 1;
  private bar() {}
}
```

#### Naming convention

Use `camelCase` for functions, methods, fields, and local variables. Use
`PascalCase` for classes, types, interfaces, and enums. Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
for static top-level items, such as `string`, `number`, `bigint`, `boolean`,
`RegExp`, arrays of static items, records of static keys and values, etc.

Good:

```ts
function generateKey() {}

let currentValue = 0;

class KeyObject {}

type SharedKey = {};

enum KeyType {
  PublicKey,
  PrivateKey,
}

const KEY_VERSION = "1.0.0";

const KEY_MAX_LENGTH = 4294967295;

const KEY_PATTERN = /^[0-9a-f]+$/;
```

Bad:

```ts
function generate_key() {}

let current_value = 0;

function GenerateKey() {}

class keyObject {}

type sharedKey = {};

enum keyType {
  publicKey,
  privateKey,
}

const key_version = "1.0.0";

const key_maxLength = 4294967295;

const KeyPattern = /^[0-9a-f]+$/;
```

When the names are in `camelCase` or `PascalCase`, always follow the rules of
them even when the parts of them are acronyms.

Note: Web APIs use uppercase acronyms (`JSON`, `URL`, `URL.createObjectURL()`
etc.). Deno Standard Library does not follow this convention.

Good:

```ts
class HttpObject {
}
```

Bad:

```ts
class HTTPObject {
}
```

Good:

```ts
function convertUrl(url: URL) {
  return url.href;
}
```

Bad:

```ts
function convertURL(url: URL) {
  return url.href;
}
```
