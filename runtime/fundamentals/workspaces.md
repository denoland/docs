Deno supports workspaces, also known as "monorepos", which allow you to manage
multiple related and interdependent packages simultaneously.

A "workspace" is a collection of folders containing `deno.json` or
`package.json` configuration files. The root `deno.json` file defines the
workspace:

```json title="deno.json"
{
  "workspace": ["./add", "./subtract"]
}
```

This configures a workspace with `add` and `subtract` members, which are
directories expected to have `deno.json(c)` and/or `package.json` files.

:::info Naming

Deno uses `workspace` rather than npm's `workspaces` to represent a singular
workspace with multiple members.

:::

## Example

Let's expand on the `deno.json` workspace example and see its functionality. The
file hierarchy looks like this:

```sh
/
├── deno.json
├── main.ts
├── add/
│     ├── deno.json
│     └── mod.ts
└── subtract/
      ├── deno.json
      └── mod.ts
```

There are two workspace members (add and subtract), each with `mod.ts` files.
There is also a root `deno.json` and a `main.ts`.

The top-level `deno.json` configuration file defines the workspace and a
top-level import map applied to all members:

```json title="deno.json"
{
  "workspace": ["./add", "./subtract"],
  "imports": {
    "chalk": "npm:chalk@5"
  }
}
```

The root `main.ts` file uses the `chalk` bare specifier from the import map and
imports the `add` and `subtract` functions from the workspace members. Note that
it imports them using `@scope/add` and `@scope/subtract`, even though these are
not proper URLs and aren't in the import map. How are they resolved?

```ts title="main.ts"
import chalk from "chalk";
import { add } from "@scope/add";
import { subtract } from "@scope/subtract";

console.log("1 + 2 =", chalk.green(add(1, 2)));
console.log("2 - 4 =", chalk.red(subtract(2, 4)));
```

In the `add/` subdirectory, we define a `deno.json` with a `"name"` field, which
is important for referencing the workspace member. The `deno.json` file also
contains example configurations, like turning off semicolons when using
`deno fmt`.

```json title="add/deno.json"
{
  "name": "@scope/add",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "exports": "./mod.ts",
  "fmt": {
    "semiColons": false
  }
}
```

```ts title="add/mod.ts"
export function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}
```

The `subtract/` subdirectory is similar but does not have the same `deno fmt`
configuration.

```json title="subtract/deno.json"
{
  "name": "@scope/subtract",
  "version": "0.3.0",
  "exports": "./mod.ts"
}
```

```ts title="subtract/mod.ts"
import { add } from "@scope/add";

export function subtract(a: number, b: number): number {
  return add(a, b * -1);
}
```

Let's run it:

```sh
> deno run main.ts
1 + 2 = 3
2 - 4 = -2
```

There's a lot to unpack here, showcasing some of the Deno workspace features:

1. This monorepo consists of two packages, placed in `./add` and `./subtract`
   directories.

1. By using `name` and `version` options in members' `deno.json` files, it's
   possible to refer to them using "bare specifiers" across the whole workspace.
   In this case, the packages are named `@scope/add` and `@scope/subtract`,
   where `scope` is the "scope" name you can choose. With these two options,
   it's not necessary to use long and relative file paths in import statements.

1. `npm:chalk@5` package is a shared dependency in the entire workspace.
   Workspace members "inherit" `imports` of the workspace root, allowing to
   easily manage a single version of a dependency across the codebase.

1. `add` subdirectory specifies in its `deno.json` that `deno fmt` should not
   apply semicolons when formatting the code. This makes for a much smoother
   transition for existing projects, without a need to change tens or hundreds
   of files in one go.

Deno workspaces are flexible and can work with Node packages. To make migration
for existing Node.js projects easier you can have both Deno-first and Node-first
packages in a single workspace.

### Migrating from `npm` workspaces

Deno workspaces support using a Deno-first package from an existing npm package.
In this example, we mix and match a Deno library called `@deno/hi`, with a
Node.js library called `@deno/log` that we developed a couple years back.

We'll need to include a `deno.json` configuration file in the root:

```json title="deno.json"
{
  "workspace": {
    "members": ["hi"]
  }
}
```

Alongside our existing package.json workspace:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "workspaces": ["log"]
}
```

The workspace currently has a log npm package:

```json title="log/package.json"
{
  "name": "@deno/log",
  "version": "0.5.0",
  "type": "module",
  "main": "index.js"
}
```

```js title="log/index.js"
export function log(output) {
  console.log(output);
}
```

Let's create an `@deno/hi` Deno-first package that imports `@deno/log`:

```json title="hi/deno.json"
{
  "name": "@deno/hi",
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "exports": "./mod.ts",
  "imports": {
    "log": "npm:@deno/log@^0.5"
  }
}
```

```ts title="hi/mod.ts"
import { log } from "log";

export function sayHiTo(name: string) {
  log(`Hi, ${name}!`);
}
```

Now, we can write a `main.ts` file that imports and calls `hi`:

```ts title="main.ts"
import { sayHiTo } from "@deno/hi";

sayHiTo("friend");
```

```sh
$ deno run main.ts
Hi, friend!
```

You can even have both `deno.json` and `package.json` in your existing Node.js
package. Additionally, you could remove the package.json in the root and specify
the npm package in the deno.json workspace members. That allows you to gradually
migrate to Deno, without putting a lot of upfront work.

For example, you can add `log/deno.json` like to to configure Deno's linter and
formatter:

```jsonc
{
  "fmt": {
    "semiColons": false
  },
  "lint": {
    "rules": {
      "exclude": ["no-unused-vars"]
    }
  }
}
```

Running `deno fmt` in the workspace, will format the `log` package to not have
any semicolons, and `deno lint` won't complain if you leave an unused var in one
of the source files.

## Configuring built-in Deno tools

Some configuration options only make sense at the root of the workspace, eg.
specifying `nodeModuleDir` option in one of the members is not available and
Deno will warn if an option needs to be applied at the workspace root.

Here's a full matrix of various `deno.json` options available at the workspace
root and its members:

| Option             | Workspace | Package | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | --------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| compilerOptions    | ✅        | ❌      | For now we only allow one set of compilerOptions per workspace this because it will require multiple changes to both deno_graph and the TSC integration to allow it. Also we’d have to determine what compilerOptions apply to remote dependencies. We can revisit this in the future. |
| importMap          | ✅        | ❌      | Exclusive with imports and scopes per config file. It is allowed to have importMap in the workspace config, and imports in the package config.                                                                                                                                         |
