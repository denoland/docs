Deno is designed with the developer in mind, aiming to provide a smooth and
enjoyable development process. Its simplicity and efficiency make it quick and
easy to pick up, even for those new to the backend development.

## Built in tooling

Deno’s inbuilt tooling significantly eases the onboarding process. With a single
executable, you can get started without worrying about complex setups or
dependencies. This allows you to focus on writing code rather than configuring
your environment.

- [Configuring your project](/runtime/fundamentals/configuration/)
- [TypeScript support](/runtime/fundamentals/testing/)
- [Linting and formatting](/runtime/fundamentals/linting_and_formatting/)
- [Testing](/runtime/fundamentals/testing/)
- [Debugging](/runtime/fundamentals/testing/)
- [HTTP server](/runtime/fundamentals/http_server/)

## Node and npm Support

Deno supports Node.js and npm packages, enabling you to leverage the vast
ecosystem of existing libraries and tools. This compatibility ensures that you
can integrate Deno into your projects seamlessly.

- [Node.js compatibility](/runtime/fundamentals/node/)
- [npm compatibility](/runtime/reference/npm/)

## Standard Library

Deno comes with a comprehensive standard library written in TypeScript. This
library includes modules for common tasks such as HTTP servers, file system
operations, and more, allowing you to avoid “reinventing the wheel” and focus on
your application’s features.

## Secure by Default

Security is a top priority for Deno. By default, it requires explicit permission
for file, network, and environment access, reducing the risk of security
vulnerabilities. This secure-by-default approach helps protect your applications
from potential threats.

## Modern Language Features

Deno embraces modern JavaScript features, including ESModules. This means you
can use the latest syntax and capabilities of the language, ensuring your code
is up-to-date and leveraging the best practices in the industry.
