Deno uses
[ECMAScript modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)
as its default module system to align with modern JavaScript standards and to
promote a more efficient and consistent development experience. It's the
official standard for JavaScript modules, allows for better tree-shaking,
improved tooling integration, and native support across different environments.

By adopting ECMAScript modules, Deno ensures compatibility with the
ever-evolving JavaScript ecosystem. For developers, this means a streamlined and
predictable module system that avoids the complexities associated with legacy
module formats like CommonJS.

## Importing modules

In this example the `add` function is imported from a local `calc.ts` module.

```ts title="calc.ts"
export function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}
```

```ts title="main.ts"
// imports the `calc.ts` module next to this file
import { add } from "./calc.ts";

console.log(add(1, 2)); // 3
```

You can run this example by calling `deno run main.ts` in the directory that
contains both `main.ts` and `calc.ts`.

With ECMAScript modules, local import specifiers must always include the full
file extension. It cannot be omitted.

```ts title="example.ts"
// WRONG: missing file extension
import { add } from "./calc";

// CORRECT: includes file extension
import { add } from "./calc.ts";
```

## Importing third party modules and libraries

When working with third-party modules in Deno, use the same `import` syntax as
you do for local code. Third party modules are typically imported from a remote
registry and start with `jsr:` , `npm:` or `https://` for URL imports.

```ts title="main.ts"
import { camelCase } from "jsr:@luca/cases@1.0.0";
import { say } from "npm:cowsay@1.6.0";
import { pascalCase } from "https://deno.land/x/case/mod.ts";
```

Deno recommends [JSR](https://jsr.io), the modern JavaScript registry, for third
party modules. There, you'll find plenty of well documented ES modules for your
projects, including the
[Deno Standard Library](/runtime/fundamentals/standard_library/).

## Managing third party modules and libraries

Typing out the module name with the full version specifier can become tedious
when importing them in multiple files. You can centralize management of remote
modules with an `imports` field in your `deno.json` file. We call this `imports`
field the **import map**.

```json title="deno.json"
{
  "imports": {
    "@luca/cases": "jsr:@luca/cases@^1.0.0",
    "cowsay": "npm:cowsay@^1.6.0",
    "cases": "https://deno.land/x/case/mod.ts"
  }
}
```

With remapped specifiers, the code looks cleaner:

```ts title="main.ts"
import { camelCase } from "@luca/cases";
import { say } from "cowsay";
import { pascalCase } from "cases";
```

The remapped name can be any valid specifier. It's a very powerful feature in
Deno that can remap anything. Learn more about everything the import map can do
[here](/runtime/manual/basics/import_maps/).

## Adding dependencies with deno add

The installation process is made easy with the `deno add` subcommand. It will
automatically add the latest version of the package you requested to the
`imports` section in `deno.json`.

```sh
# Add the latest version of the module to deno.json
$ deno add  @luca/cases
Add @luca/cases - jsr:@luca/cases@^1.0.0
```

```json title="deno.json"
{
  "imports": {
    "@luca/cases": "jsr:@luca/cases@^1.0.0"
  }
}
```

You can also specify an exact version:

```sh
# Passing an exact version
$ deno add @luca/cases@1.0.0
Add @luca/cases - jsr:@luca/cases@^1.0.0
```

## Package Versions

It is possible to specify a version range for the package you are importing.
This is done using the `@` symbol followed by a version range specifier, and
follows the [semver](https://semver.org/) versioning scheme.

For example:

```bash
@scopename/mypackage           # latest version
@scopename/mypackage@16.1.0    # exact version
@scopename/mypackage@^16.1.0   # latest patch version 16.x
@scopename/mypackage@~16.1.0   # latest version that doesn't increment the first non-zero portion
```

Here is an overview of all the ways you can specify a version or a range:

| Symbol    | Description                                                                                                                                                         | Example   |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `1.2.3`   | An exact version. Only this specific version will be used.                                                                                                          | `1.2.3`   |
| `^1.2.3`  | Compatible with version 1.2.3. Allows updates that do not change the leftmost non-zero digit. <br>For example, `1.2.4` and `1.3.0` are allowed, but `2.0.0` is not. | `^1.2.3`  |
| `~1.2.3`  | Approximately equivalent to version 1.2.3. Allows updates to the patch version. <br> For example, `1.2.4` is allowed, but `1.3.0` is not.                           | `~1.2.3`  |
| `>=1.2.3` | Greater than or equal to version 1.2.3. Any version `1.2.3` or higher is allowed.                                                                                   | `>=1.2.3` |
| `<=1.2.3` | Less than or equal to version 1.2.3. Any version `1.2.3` or lower is allowed.                                                                                       | `<=1.2.3` |
| `>1.2.3`  | Greater than version 1.2.3. Only versions higher than `1.2.3` are allowed.                                                                                          | `>1.2.3`  |
| `<1.2.3`  | Less than version 1.2.3. Only versions lower than `1.2.3` are allowed.                                                                                              | `<1.2.3`  |
| `1.2.x`   | Any patch version within the minor version 1.2. For example, `1.2.0`, `1.2.1`, etc.                                                                                 | `1.2.x`   |
| `1.x`     | Any minor and patch version within the major version 1. For example, `1.0.0`, `1.1.0`, `1.2.0`, etc.                                                                | `1.x`     |
| `*`       | Any version is allowed.                                                                                                                                             | `*`       |

## URL imports

Deno also supports import statements that reference URLs, either directly:

```js
import { Application } from "https://deno.land/x/oak/mod.ts";
```

or part of your `deno.json` import map:

```json
{
  "imports": {
    "oak": "https://deno.land/x/oak/mod.ts"
  }
}
```

Supporting URL imports enables us to support the following JavaScript CDNs, as
they provide URL access to JavaScript modules:

- [deno.land/x](https://deno.land/x)
- [esm.sh](https://esm.sh)
- [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com)

URL imports are useful if you have a small, often single file, Deno project that
doesn't require any other configuration. With URL imports, you can avoid having
a `Deno.json` file at all. It is **not** advised to use this style of import in
larger applications however, as you may end up with version conflicts (where
different files use different version specifiers).

:::info

Use URL imports with caution, and only **from trusted sources**. If the server
is compromised, it could serve malicious code to your application. They can also
cause versioning issues if you import different versions in different files. URL
imports remain supported, **but we recommend using a package registry for the
best experience.**

:::

### Overriding URL imports

The other situation where import maps can be very useful is to override URL
imports in specific modules.

Let's say you want to override a `https://deno.land/x/my-library@1.0.0/mod.ts`
specifier that is used inside files coming from `https://deno.land/x/example/`
to a local patched version. You can do this by using a scope in the import map
that looks something like this:

```json
{
  "imports": {
    "example/": "https://deno.land/x/example/"
  },
  "scopes": {
    "https://deno.land/x/example/": {
      "https://deno.land/x/my-library@1.0.0/mod.ts": "./patched/mod.ts"
    }
  }
}
```

:::note

URL imports have no notion of packages. Only the import map at the root of your
project is used. Import maps used inside URL dependencies are ignored.

:::

## Publishing modules

Any Deno program that defines an export can be published as a module. This
allows other developers to import and use your code in their own projects.
Modules can be published to:

- [JSR](https://jsr.io) - recommended, supports TypeScript natively and
  auto-generates documentation for you
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) - use [dnt](https://github.com/denoland/dnt) to
  create the npm package
- [deno.land/x](https://deno.com/add_module) - for URL imports, use JSR instead
  if possible

## Reloading modules

By default, Deno uses a global cache directory (`DENO_DIR`) for downloaded
dependencies. This cache is shared across all projects.

You can force deno to refetch and recompile modules into the cache using the
`--reload` flag.

```bash
# Reload everything
deno run --reload my_module.ts

# Reload a specific module
deno run --reload=jsr:@std/fs my_module.ts
```

## Vendoring

If your project has external dependencies, you may want to store them locally to
avoid downloading them from the internet every time you build your project. This
is especially useful when building your project on a CI server or in a Docker
container, or patching or otherwise modifying the remote dependencies.

Deno offers this functionality through a setting in your `deno.json` file:

```json
{
  "vendor": true
}
```

Add the above snippet to your `deno.json` file and Deno will cache all
dependencies locally in a `vendor` directory when the project is run, or you can
optionally run the `deno cache` command to cache the dependencies immediately:

```bash
deno cache main.ts
```

You can then run the application as usual with `deno run`:

```bash
deno run main.ts
```

After vendoring, you can run `main.ts` without internet access by using the
`--cached-only` flag, which forces Deno to use only locally available modules.

## Integrity Checking and Lock Files

Imagine your module relies on a remote module located at https://some.url/a.ts.
When you compile your module for the first time, `a.ts` is fetched, compiled,
and cached. This cached version will be used until you either run your module on
a different machine (such as in a production environment) or manually reload the
cache (using a command like `deno cache --reload`).

But what if the content at `https://some.url/a.ts` changes? This could result in
your production module running with different dependency code than your local
module. To prevent this, Deno uses integrity checking and lock files.

Deno uses a `deno.lock` file to check external module integrity. To opt into a
lock file, either:

1. Create a `deno.json` file in the current or an ancestor directory, which will
   automatically create an additive lockfile at `deno.lock`.
2. Use the `--lock=deno.lock` flag to enable and specify lock file checking. To
   update or create a lock use `--lock=deno.lock --frozen=false`. The
   `--lock=deno.lock` tells Deno what the lock file to use is, while the
   `--frozen=false` is used to output dependency hashes to the lock file.

A `deno.lock` might look like this, storing a hash of the file against the
dependency:

```json title="deno.lock"
{
  "https://deno.land/std@0.224.0/textproto/mod.ts": "3118d7a42c03c242c5a49c2ad91c8396110e14acca1324e7aaefd31a999b71a4",
  "https://deno.land/std@0.224.0/io/util.ts": "ae133d310a0fdcf298cea7bc09a599c49acb616d34e148e263bcb02976f80dee",
  "https://deno.land/std@0.224.0/async/delay.ts": "35957d585a6e3dd87706858fb1d6b551cb278271b03f52c5a2cb70e65e00c26a",
   ...
}
```

### Auto-generated lockfile

As mentioned above, when a Deno configuration file is resolved (eg.
`deno.json`), a lockfile will be automatically generated. By default, the path
of this lockfile will be in the directory root - `deno.lock`. You can change
this path by updating your `deno.json` to specify this:

````json title="deno.json"
{
  "lock": "./lock.file"
}

You can disable the automatic creation and validation of a lockfile by specifying:

```json title="deno.json"
{
  "lock": false
}
````

### Using `--lock` and `--frozen=false` flags

You may have a file that imports a dependency and looks something like this:

```ts title="src/deps.ts"
export { xyz } from "https://unpkg.com/xyz-lib@v0.9.0/lib.ts";
```

To create a lock file, you can use the `--lock` and `--frozen=false` flags:

```shell
# Create/update the lock file "deno.lock".
deno cache --lock=deno.lock --frozen=false src/deps.ts

# Include it when committing to source control.
git add -u deno.lock
git commit -m "feat: Add support for xyz using xyz-lib"
git push
```

Collaborator on another machine -- in a freshly cloned project tree:

```shell
# Download the project's dependencies into the machine's cache, integrity
# checking each resource.
deno cache --reload --lock=deno.lock src/deps.ts

# Done! You can proceed safely.
deno test --allow-read src
```

### Runtime verification

Like caching above, you can also use lock files during use of the `deno run` sub
command, validating the integrity of any locked modules during the run. Remember
that this only validates against dependencies previously added to the lock file.

You can take this a step further by using the `--cached-only` flag to require
that remote dependencies are already cached.

```shell
deno run --lock=deno.lock --cached-only mod.ts
```

This will fail if there are any dependencies in the dependency tree for mod.ts
which are not yet cached.
