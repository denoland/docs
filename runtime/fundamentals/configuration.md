You can configure Deno using a `deno.json` file. This file can be used to
configure the TypeScript compiler, linter, formatter, and other Deno tools.

The configuration file supports `.json` and
[`.jsonc`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/json#_json-with-comments)
extensions.

Deno will automatically detect a `deno.json` or `deno.jsonc` configuration file
if it's in your current working directory or parent directories. The `--config`
flag can be used to specify a different configuration file.

## package.json support

Deno also supports a `package.json` file for compatibility with Node.js
projects. If you have a Node.js project, it is not necessary to create a
`deno.json` file. Deno will use the `package.json` file to configure the
project.

If both a `deno.json` and `package.json` file are present in the same directory,
Deno will understand dependencies specified in both `deno.json` and
`package.json`; and use the `deno.json` file for Deno-specific configurations.
Read more about
[Node compatibility in Deno](/runtime/fundamentals/node/#node-compatibility).

## Dependencies

The `"imports"` field in your `deno.json` allows you to specify dependencies
used in your project. You can use it to map bare specifiers to URLs or file
paths making it easier to manage dependencies and module resolution in your
applications.

For example, if you want to use the `assert` module from the standard library in
your project, you could use this import map:

```json title="deno.json"
{
  "imports": {
    "@std/assert": "jsr:@std/assert@^1.0.0",
    "chalk": "npm:chalk@5"
  }
}
```

Then your script can use the bare specifier `std/assert`:

```js title="script.ts"
import { assertEquals } from "@std/assert";
import chalk from "chalk";

assertEquals(1, 2);
console.log(chalk.yellow("Hello world"));
```

You can also use a `"dependencies"` field in `package.json`:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "express@^1.0.0"
  }
}
```

```js title="script.ts"
import express from "express";

const app = express();
```

[module imports and dependencies](/runtime/fundamentals/modules/)

### Custom path mappings

The import map in `deno.json` can be used for more general path mapping of
specifiers. You can map an exact specifiers to a third party module or a file
directly, or you can map a part of an import specifier to a directory.

```jsonc title="deno.jsonc"
{
  "imports": {
    // Map to an exact file
    "foo": "./some/long/path/foo.ts",
    // Map to a directory, usage: "bar/file.ts"
    "bar/": "./some/folder/bar/"
  }
}
```

Usage:

```ts
import * as foo from "foo";
import * as bar from "bar/file.ts";
```

Path mapping of import specifies is commonly used in larger code bases for
brevity.

To use your project root for absolute imports:

```json title="deno.json"
{
  "imports": {
    "/": "./",
    "./": "./"
  }
}
```

```ts title="main.ts"
import { MyUtil } from "/util.ts";
```

This causes import specifiers starting with `/` to be resolved relative to the
import map's URL or file path.

## Tasks

The `tasks` field in your `deno.json` file is used to define custom commands
that can be executed with the `deno task` command and allows you to tailor
commands and permissions to the specific needs of your project.

It is similar to the `scripts` field in a `package.json` file, which is also
supported.

```json title="deno.json"
{
  "tasks": {
    "start": "deno run --allow-net --watch=static/,routes/,data/ dev.ts",
    "test": "deno test --allow-net",
    "lint": "deno lint"
  }
}
```

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite dev",
    "build": "vite build"
  }
}
```

To execute a task, use the `deno task` command followed by the task name. For
example:

```sh
deno task start
deno task test
deno task lint
deno task dev
deno task build
```

Read more about [`deno task`](/runtime/reference/cli/task_runner/).

## Linting

The `lint` field in the `deno.json` file is used to configure the behavior of
Deno’s built-in linter. This allows you to specify which files to include or
exclude from linting, as well as customize the linting rules to suit your
project’s needs.

For example:

```json title="deno.json"
{
  "lint": {
    "include": ["src/"],
    "exclude": ["src/testdata/", "src/fixtures/**/*.ts"],
    "rules": {
      "tags": ["recommended"],
      "include": ["ban-untagged-todo"],
      "exclude": ["no-unused-vars"]
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration will:

- only lint files in the `src/` directory,
- will not lint files in the `src/testdata/` directory or any TypeScript files
  in the `src/fixtures/` directory.
- specifies that the recommended linting rules should be applied,
- adds the `ban-untagged-todo`
- removes the `no-unused-vars` rule excluded.

You can find a full list of available linting rules in the
[Deno lint documentation](https://lint.deno.land/).

Read more about [linting with Deno](/runtime/reference/cli/linter/).

## Formatting

The `fmt` field in the `deno.json` file is used to configure the behavior of
Deno’s built-in code formatter. This allows you to customize how your code is
formatted, ensuring consistency across your project, making it easier to read
and collaborate on. Here are the key options you can configure:

```json title="deno.json"
{
  "fmt": {
    "useTabs": true,
    "lineWidth": 80,
    "indentWidth": 4,
    "semiColons": true,
    "singleQuote": true,
    "proseWrap": "preserve",
    "include": ["src/"],
    "exclude": ["src/testdata/", "src/fixtures/**/*.ts"]
  }
}
```

This configuration will:

- use tabs instead of spaces for indentation,
- limit lines to 80 characters,
- use an indentation width of 4 spaces,
- add semicolons to the end of statements,
- use single quotes for strings,
- preserve prose wrapping,
- format files in the `src/` directory,
- exclude files in the `src/testdata/` directory and any TypeScript files in the
  `src/fixtures/` directory.

Read more about
[formatting your code with Deno](/runtime/fundamentals/linting_and_formatting/).

## Lockfile

The `lock` field in the `deno.json` file is used to specify configuration of the
lock file that Deno uses to
[ensure the integrity of your dependencies](/runtime/fundamentals/modules/#integrity-checking-and-lock-files).
A lock file records the exact versions and integrity hashes of the modules your
project depends on, ensuring that the same versions are used every time the
project is run, even if the dependencies are updated or changed remotely.

```json title="deno.json"
{
  "lock": {
    "path": "./deno.lock",
    "frozen": true
  }
}
```

This configuration will:

- specify lockfile location at `./deno.lock` (this is the default and can be
  omitted)
- tell Deno that you want to error out if any dependency changes

Deno uses lockfile by default, you can disable it with following configuration:

```json title="deno.json"
{
  "lock": false
}
```

## Node modules directory

By default Deno uses a local `node_modules` directory if you have a
`package.json` file in your project directory.

You can control this behavior using the `nodeModulesDir` field in the
`deno.json` file.

```json title="deno.json"
{
  "nodeModulesDir": "auto"
}
```

You can set this field to following values:

| Value      | Behavior                                                                                                                            |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `"none"`   | Don't use a local `node_modules` directory. Instead use global cache in `$DENO_DIR` that is automatically kept up to date by Deno.  |
| `"auto"`   | Use a local `node_modules` directory. The directory is automatically create and kept up to date by Deno.                            |
| `"manual"` | Use a local `node_modules` directory. User must keep this directory up to date manually, eg. using `deno install` or `npm install`. |

It is not required to specify this setting, the following defaults are applied:

- `"none"` if there is no `package.json` file in your project directory
- `"manual"` if there is a `package.json` file in your project directory

When using workspaces, this setting can only be used in the workspace root.
Specifying it in any of the members will result in warnings. The `"manual"`
setting will only be applied automatically if there's a `package.json` file in
the workspace root.

## TypeScript compiler options

The `compilerOptions` field in the `deno.json` file is used to configure
[TypeScript compiler settings](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig) for your
Deno project. This allows you to customize how TypeScript code is compiled,
ensuring it aligns with your project’s requirements and coding standards.

:::info

Deno recommends the default TypeScript configuration. This will help when
sharing code.

## Unstable features

The `unstable` field in a `deno.json` file is used to enable specific unstable
features for your Deno project.

These features are still in development and not yet part of the stable API. By
listing features in the `unstable` array, you can experiment with and use these
new capabilities before they are officially released.

```json title="deno.json"
{
  "unstable": ["cron", "kv", "webgpu"]
}
```

[Learn more](/runtime/reference/cli/unstable_flags/).

## include and exclude

Many configurations (ex. `lint`, `fmt`) have an `include` and `exclude` property
for specifying the files to include.

### include

Only the paths or patterns specified here will be included.

```jsonc
{
  "lint": {
    // only format the src/ directory
    "include": ["src/"]
  }
}
```

### exclude

The paths or patterns specified here will be excluded.

```jsonc
{
  "lint": {
    // don't lint the dist/ folder
    "exclude": ["dist/"]
  }
}
```

This has HIGHER precedence than `include` and will win over `include` if a path
is matched in both `include` and `exclude`.

You may wish to exclude a directory, but include a sub directory. In Deno
1.41.2+, you may un-exclude a more specific path by specifying a negated glob
below the more general exclude:

```jsonc
{
  "fmt": {
    // don't format the "fixtures" directory,
    // but do format "fixtures/scripts"
    "exclude": [
      "fixtures",
      "!fixtures/scripts"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Top level exclude

If there's a directory you never want Deno to fmt, lint, type check, analyze in
the LSP, etc., then specify it in the top level exclude array:

```jsonc
{
  "exclude": [
    // exclude the dist folder from all sub-commands and the LSP
    "dist/"
  ]
}
```

Sometimes you may find that you want to un-exclude a path or pattern that's
excluded in the top level-exclude. In Deno 1.41.2+, you may un-exclude a path by
specifying a negated glob in a more specific config:

```jsonc
{
  "fmt": {
    "exclude": [
      // format the dist folder even though it's
      // excluded at the top level
      "!dist"
    ]
  },
  "exclude": [
    "dist/"
  ]
}
```

### Publish - Override .gitignore

The `.gitignore` is taken into account for the `deno publish` command. In Deno
1.41.2+, you can opt-out of excluded files ignored in the _.gitignore_ by using
a negated exclude glob:

```title=".gitignore"
dist/
.env
```

```jsonc title="deno.json"
{
  "publish": {
    "exclude": [
      // include the .gitignored dist folder
      "!dist/"
    ]
  }
}
```

Alternatively, explicitly specifying the gitignored paths in an `"include"`
works as well:

```json
{
  "publish": {
    "include": [
      "dist/",
      "README.md",
      "deno.json"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Full example

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "allowJs": true,
    "lib": ["deno.window"],
    "strict": true
  },
  "lint": {
    "include": ["src/"],
    "exclude": ["src/testdata/", "src/fixtures/**/*.ts"],
    "rules": {
      "tags": ["recommended"],
      "include": ["ban-untagged-todo"],
      "exclude": ["no-unused-vars"]
    }
  },
  "fmt": {
    "useTabs": true,
    "lineWidth": 80,
    "indentWidth": 4,
    "semiColons": false,
    "singleQuote": true,
    "proseWrap": "preserve",
    "include": ["src/"],
    "exclude": ["src/testdata/", "src/fixtures/**/*.ts"]
  },
  "lock": false,
  "nodeModulesDir": "auto",
  "unstable": ["webgpu"],
  "test": {
    "include": ["src/"],
    "exclude": ["src/testdata/", "src/fixtures/**/*.ts"]
  },
  "tasks": {
    "start": "deno run --allow-read main.ts"
  },
  "imports": {
    "oak": "jsr:@oak/oak"
  },
  "exclude": [
    "dist/"
  ]
}
```
