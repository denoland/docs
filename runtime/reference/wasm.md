Designed to be used alongside JavaScript to speed up key application components,
[WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) (WASM) can have much higher, and more
consistent execution speed than JavaScript - similar to C, C++, or Rust. Deno
can execute WebAssembly modules with the same interfaces that
[browsers provide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly).

## Using WebAssembly in Deno

To run WebAssembly in Deno, all you need is a binary to run. The following
binary exports a `main` function that just returns `42` upon invocation:

```ts
// deno-fmt-ignore
const wasmCode = new Uint8Array([
  0, 97, 115, 109, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 133, 128, 128, 128, 0, 1, 96, 0, 1, 127,
  3, 130, 128, 128, 128, 0, 1, 0, 4, 132, 128, 128, 128, 0, 1, 112, 0, 0,
  5, 131, 128, 128, 128, 0, 1, 0, 1, 6, 129, 128, 128, 128, 0, 0, 7, 145,
  128, 128, 128, 0, 2, 6, 109, 101, 109, 111, 114, 121, 2, 0, 4, 109, 97,
  105, 110, 0, 0, 10, 138, 128, 128, 128, 0, 1, 132, 128, 128, 128, 0, 0,
  65, 42, 11
]);

const wasmModule = new WebAssembly.Module(wasmCode);

const wasmInstance = new WebAssembly.Instance(wasmModule);

const main = wasmInstance.exports.main as CallableFunction;
console.log(main().toString());
```

In order to load WebAssembly in a JavaScript program, the following steps need
to be performed:

1. Fetching the binary (usually in the form of a `.wasm` file, though we are
   using a simple byte array for now)
2. Compiling the binary into a `WebAssembly.Module` object
3. Instantiating the WebAssembly module

WebAssembly is a binary data format, not intended to be human readable, nor to
be written by hand. Your wasm files should be generated by a compiler for a
language such as [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Go](https://golang.org/)
or [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org/).

As an example, a Rust program that compiles to the aforementioned bytes would
look something like this:

```rust
pub fn main() -> u32 {  // u32 stands for an unsigned integer using 32 bits of memory.
  42
}
```

## Using the Streaming WebAssembly APIs

The [most efficient](/api/web/~/WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming) way to fetch,
compile and instantiate a WebAssembly module is to use the streaming variants of
the WebAssembly API. For example, you can use `instantiateStreaming` combined
with `fetch` to perform all three steps in one go:

```ts
const { instance, module } = await WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(
  fetch("https://wpt.live/wasm/incrementer.wasm"),
);

const increment = instance.exports.increment as (input: number) => number;
console.log(increment(41));
```

Note that the `.wasm` file must be served with the `application/wasm` MIME type.
If you want to do additional work on the module before instantiation you can
instead use [`compileStreaming`](/api/web/~/WebAssembly.compileStreaming):

```ts
const module = await WebAssembly.compileStreaming(
  fetch("https://wpt.live/wasm/incrementer.wasm"),
);

/* do some more stuff */

const instance = await WebAssembly.instantiate(module);
instance.exports.increment as (input: number) => number;
```

If for some reason you cannot make use of the streaming methods you can fall
back to the less efficient [`compile`](/api/web/~/WebAssembly.compile) and
[`instantiate`](/api/web/~/WebAssembly.instantiate) methods.

For a more in-depth look on what makes the streaming methods more performant,

## WebAssembly API

Further information on all parts of the WebAssembly API can be found on in the
[Deno Reference Guide](/api/web/~/WebAssembly) and on
[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly).

## Working with Non-Numeric Types

The code samples in this document only used numeric types in the WebAssembly
modules. To run WebAssembly with more complex types (such as strings or classes)
you will need to use tools that generate type bindings between JavaScript and
the language used to compile to WebAssembly.

An example on how to create type bindings between JavaScript and Rust, compiling
it into a binary and calling it from a JavaScript program can be found on
[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Rust_to_wasm).

If you plan to do a lot of work with Web APIs in Rust+WebAssembly, you may find
the [web_sys](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/web-sys/index.html) and
[js_sys](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/contributing/js-sys/index.html)
Rust crates useful. `web_sys` contains bindings to most of the Web APIs that are
available in Deno, while `js_sys` provides bindings to JavaScript's standard,
built-in objects.

## Optimization

For production builds you can perform optimizations on WebAssembly binaries. If
you're serving binaries over a network then optimizing for size can make a real
difference. If you're mainly executing WebAssembly on a server to perform
computationally intensive tasks, optimizing for speed can be beneficial. You can
find a good guide on optimizing (production) builds
[here](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/reference/code-size.html). In
addition, the
[rust-wasm group](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/reference/tools.html) has
a list of tools that can be used to optimize and manipulate WebAssembly
binaries.
