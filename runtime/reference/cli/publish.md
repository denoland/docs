_This applies to `deno` v1.42.0. and above._

Publish a package or workspace to [JSR](https://jsr.io/).

## Command

`deno publish [OPTIONS]` - Publish the current working directory's package or
workspace.

## Synopsis

```bash
deno publish [--token <token>] [-c|--config <FILE>] [-q|--quiet]
[--no-config] [--dry-run] [--allow-slow-types] [--allow-dirty]
[--no-provenance] [--check[=<CHECK_TYPE>]] [--no-check[=<NO_CHECK_TYPE>]]

deno publish -h|--help
```

## Description

The `deno publish` command is used to
[publish a package or workspace](https://jsr.io/docs/publishing-packages) to
[JSR](https://jsr.io/).

The command will upload the package to the registry and make it available for
others to use.

## Package Requirements

Your package must have a `name` and `version` and an `exports` field in its
`deno.json` or `jsr.json` file.

- The `name` field must be unique and follow the `@<scope_name>/<package_name>`
  convention.
- The `version` field must be a valid semver version.
- The `exports` field must point to the main entry point of the package.

Example:

```json title="deno.json"
{
  "name": "@scope_name/package_name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "exports": "./main.ts"
}
```

Before you publish your package, you must create it in the registry by visiting
[JSR - Publish a package](https://jsr.io/new).

## Arguments

There are no required arguments for this command - it should be run from within
your package or workspace directory.

## Options

- `--token <token>`

  The API token to use when publishing. If unset, interactive authentication
  will be used

- `-c, --config <FILE>`

  The configuration file can be used to configure different aspects of deno
  including TypeScript, linting, and code formatting. Typically the
  configuration file will be called `deno.json` or `deno.jsonc` and
  automatically detected; in that case this flag is not necessary. See
  [https://deno.land/manual@v1.41.3/getting_started/configuration_file](https://deno.land/manual@v1.41.3/getting_started/configuration_file)

- `-q, --quiet`

  Suppress diagnostic output

- `--no-config`

  Disable automatic loading of the configuration file.

- `--dry-run`

  Prepare the package for publishing performing all checks and validations
  without uploading

- `--allow-slow-types`

  Allow publishing with slow types

- `--allow-dirty`

  Allow publishing if the repository has uncommitted changed

- `--no-provenance`

  Disable provenance attestation. Enabled by default on Github actions, publicly
  links the package to where it was built and published from.

- `--check[=<CHECK_TYPE>]`

  Set type-checking behavior. This subcommand type-checks local modules by
  default, so adding --check is redundant. If the value of '--check=all' is
  supplied, diagnostic errors from remote modules will be included.

  Alternatively, the 'deno check' subcommand can be used.

- `--no-check[=<NO_CHECK_TYPE>]`

  Skip type-checking. If the value of '--no-check=remote' is supplied,
  diagnostic errors from remote modules will be ignored

- `-h, --help`

  Print help (see a summary with '-h')

## Examples

- Publish your current workspace

```bash
deno publish
```

- Publish your current workspace with a specific token, bypassing interactive
  authentication

```bash
deno publish --token c00921b1-0d4f-4d18-b8c8-ac98227f9275
```

- Publish and check for errors in remote modules

```bash
deno publish --check=all
```

- Perform a dry run to simulate publishing.

```bash
deno publish --dry-run
```

- Publish using settings from a specific configuration file

```bash
deno publish --config custom-config.json
```
