Any Deno program that defines an export can be published as a module. This
allows other developers to import and use your code in their own projects.
Modules can be published to [JSR](https://jsr.io).

## Configuring your module

To configure your module for publishing, you need to ensure you have the
following properties defined in a `deno.json` file at the root of your project:

```json title="deno.json"
{
  "name": "@my-scope/my-module",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "exports": "./mod.ts"
}
```

In order to publish, you need a
[JSR scope and a new package](https://jsr.io/docs/publishing-packages#creating-a-scope-and-package)
to identify your module. You can create your scope and package at
[jsr.io/new](https://jsr.io/new).

The `name` property in your `deno.json` file is a concatenation of your scope
and package name, separated by a `/`. The `exports` property should point to the
main entry point of your module.

## Publishing your module

Packages can be published to JSR in the CLI with the
[`deno publish` command](https://jsr.io/docs/publishing-packages#publishing-from-your-local-machine).

To publish your module, run the following command in the root of your project:

```bash
deno publish
```

Before publishing, you can use the `--dry-run` flag locally to test the
publishing process, without actually publishing your module. This will print out
a list of all of the files that will be published and can be used to verify that
your module is set up correctly:

```bash
deno publish --dry-run
```

## Authentication

You can publish your modules from the browser at
[jsr.io/new](https://jsr.io/new).

You can also publish your package with a GitHub Action. Link your repository by
following the instructions at
[jsr.io/docs/publishing-packages#publishing-from-github-actions](https://jsr.io/docs/publishing-packages#publishing-from-github-actions).
This will allow you to publish packages without needing to provide an auth token
and instead uses OIDC authentication from GitHub itself.

## Publishing for Node

Library authors may want to make their Deno modules available to Node.js users.
This is possible by using the [dnt](https://github.com/denoland/dnt) build tool.

dnt allows you to develop your Deno module mostly as-is and use a single Deno
script to build, type check, and test an npm package in an output directory.
Once built, you only need to `npm publish` the output directory to distribute it
to Node.js users.
