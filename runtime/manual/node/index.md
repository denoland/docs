Modern Node.js projects will run in Deno with little to no reworking required.
However, there are some key differences between the two runtimes that you can
take advantage of to make your code simpler and smaller when migrating your
Node.js projects to Deno.

## Unstable compatibility features

Node and npm compatibility is an ongoing project for the Deno team. As such,
there are a number of unstable features aimed at improving compatibility that
you may want to reference. Please check out the
[unstable feature flags](/runtime/manual/tools/unstable_flags) documentation for
options that may improve your project's compatibility with code written for
Node.js.
