[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) (often abbreviated as OTel) is an
open-source observability framework that provides a standardized way to collect
and export telemetry data such as traces, metrics and logs. Deno has built-in
support for OpenTelemetry, making it easy to instrument your applications
without adding external dependencies. This integration works out of the box with
observability platforms like [Grafana](https://grafana.com/).

Grafana is an open-source observability platform that lets DevOps teams
visualize, query, and alert on metrics, logs, and traces from diverse data
sources in real time. Itâ€™s widely used for building dashboards to monitor
infrastructure, applications, and systems health.

Grafana also offers a hosted version called
[Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/products/cloud/). This tutorial will help
you configure your project to export OTel data to Grafana Cloud.

In this tutorial, we'll build a simple application and export its telemetry data
to Grafana Cloud. We'll cover:

- [Set up your chat app](#set-up-your-chat-app)
- [Set up a Docker collector](#set-up-a-docker-collector)
- [Generating telemetry data](#generating-telemetry-data)
- [Viewing telemetry data](#viewing-telemetry-data)

You can find the complete source code for this tutorial
[on GitHub](https://github.com/denoland/examples/tree/main/with-grafana).

## Set up your chat app

For this tutorial, we'll use a simple chat application to demonstrate how to
export telemetry data. You can find the
[code for the app on GitHub](https://github.com/denoland/examples/tree/main/with-grafana).

Either take a copy of that repository or create a
[main.ts](https://github.com/denoland/examples/blob/main/with-grafana/main.ts)
file and a
[.env](https://github.com/denoland/examples/blob/main/with-grafana/.env.example)
file.

In order to run the app you will need an OpenAI API key. You can get one by
signing up for an account at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/signup) and
creating a new secret key. You can find your API key in the
[API keys section](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) of your OpenAI
account. Once you have an API key, set up an `OPENAI_API-KEY` environment
variable in your `.env` file:

```env title=".env"
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

## Set up a Docker collector

Next, we'll set up a Docker container to run the OpenTelemetry collector. The
collector is responsible for receiving telemetry data from your application and
exporting it to Grafana Cloud.

In the same directory as your `main.ts` file, create a `Dockerfile` and an
`otel-collector.yml` file. The `Dockerfile` will be used to build a Docker
image:

```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
FROM otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:latest

COPY otel-collector.yml /otel-config.yml

CMD ["--config", "/otel-config.yml"]
```

[`FROM otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:latest`](https://hub.docker.com/r/otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/) -
This line specifies the base image for the container. It uses the official
OpenTelemetry Collector Contributor image, which contains all receivers,
exporters, processors, connectors, and other optional components, and pulls the
latest version.

`COPY otel-collector.yml /otel-config.yml` - This instruction copies our
configuration file named `otel-collector.yml` from the local build context into
the container. The file is renamed to `/otel-config.yml` inside the container.

`CMD ["--config", "/otel-config.yml"]` - This sets the default command that will
run when the container starts. It tells the OpenTelemetry Collector to use the
configuration file we copied in the previous step.

Next, let's setup a Grafana Cloud account and grab some info.

If you have not already,
[create a free Grafana Cloud account](https://grafana.com/auth/sign-up/create-user).
Once created, you will receive a Grafana Cloud stack. Click "Details".

![Click details on your Grafana Cloud stack](./images/how-to/grafana/grafana-1.png)

Next, find "OpenTelemetry" and click "Configure".

![Find and configure OpenTelemetry](./images/how-to/grafana/grafana-2.png)

This page will provide you with all the details you'll need to configure your
OpenTelemetry collector. Make note of your **OTLP Endpoint**, **Instance ID**,
and **Password / API Token** (you will have to generate one).

![Configuring OTel in Grafana Cloud](./images/how-to/grafana/grafana-3.png)

Next, add the following to your `otel-collector.yml` file to define how how
telemetry data should be collected and exported to Grafana Cloud:

```yml title="otel-collector.yml"
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318

exporters:
  otlphttp/grafana_cloud:
    endpoint: $_YOUR_GRAFANA_OTLP_ENDPOINT
    auth:
      authenticator: basicauth/grafana_cloud

extensions:
  basicauth/grafana_cloud:
    client_auth:
      username: $_YOUR_INSTANCE_ID
      password: $_YOUR_API_TOKEN

processors:
  batch:

service:
  extensions: [basicauth/grafana_cloud]
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlphttp/grafana_cloud]
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlphttp/grafana_cloud]
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlphttp/grafana_cloud]
```

The `receivers` section configures how the collector receives data. It sets up
an OTLP (OpenTelemetry Protocol) receiver that listens on two protocols, `gRPC`
and `HTTP`, the `0.0.0.0` address means it will accept data from any source.

The `exporters` section defines where the collected data should be sent. Be sure
to include **the OTLP endpoint** provided by your Grafana Cloud instance.

The `extensions` section defines the authentication for OTel to export data to
Grafana Cloud. Be sure to include your Grafana Cloud **Instance ID**, as well as
your generated **Password / API Token**.

The `processors` section defines how the data should be processed before export.
It uses batch processing with a timeout of 5 seconds and a maximum batch size of
5000 items.

The `service` section ties everything together by defining three pipelines. Each
pipeline is responsible for a different type of telemetry data. The logs
pipeline collects application logs. The traces pipeline is for distributed
tracing data. The metric pipeline is for performance metrics.

Build and run the docker instance to start collecting your telemetry data with
the following command:

```sh
docker build -t otel-collector . && docker run -p 4317:4317 -p 4318:4318 otel-collector
```

## Generating telemetry data

Now that we have the app and the docker container set up, we can start
generating telemetry data. Run your application with these environment variables
to send data to the collector:

```sh
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318 \
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=chat-app \
OTEL_DENO=true \
deno run --unstable-otel --allow-net --allow-env --env-file --allow-read main.ts
```

This command:

- Points the OpenTelemetry exporter to your local collector (`localhost:4318`)
- Names your service "chat-app" in Grafana Cloud
- Enables Deno's OpenTelemetry integration
- Runs your application with the necessary permissions

To generate some telemetry data, make a few requests to your running application
in your browser at [`http://localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000).

Each request will:

1. Generate traces as it flows through your application
2. Send logs from your application's console output
3. Create metrics about the request performance
4. Forward all this data through the collector to Grafana Cloud

## Viewing telemetry data

After making some requests to your application, you'll see three types of data
in your Grafana Cloud dashboard:

1. **Traces** - End-to-end request flows through your system
2. **Logs** - Console output and structured log data
3. **Metrics** - Performance and resource utilization data

![Viewing logs in Grafana](./images/how-to/grafana/grafana-logs.png)

You can drill down into individual spans to debug performance issues:

![Viewing traces in Grafana](./images/how-to/grafana/grafana-traces.png)

ðŸ¦• Now that you have telemetry export working, you could:

1. Add custom spans and attributes to better understand your application
2. Set up alerts based on latency or error conditions
3. Deploy your application and collector to production using platforms like:
   - [Fly.io](https://docs.deno.com/examples/deploying_deno_with_docker/)
   - [Digital Ocean](https://docs.deno.com/examples/digital_ocean_tutorial/)
   - [AWS Lightsail](https://docs.deno.com/examples/aws_lightsail_tutorial/)
