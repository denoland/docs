[HyperDX](https://hyperdx.io) is an open source observability platform that
unifies logs, traces, metrics, exceptions, and session replays into a single
interface. It helps developers debug applications faster by providing a complete
view of your system's behavior and performance.

[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) (often abbreviated as OTel) provides
a standardized way to collect and export telemetry data. Deno includes built-in
OpenTelemetry support, allowing you to instrument your applications without
additional dependencies. This integration works seamlessly with platforms like
HyperDX to collect and visualize telemetry data.

In this tutorial, we'll build a simple application and export its telemetry data
to HyperDX:

- [Setting up your application](#setup-your-app)
- [Configuring the OpenTelemetry collector](#setup-the-collector)
- [Viewing telemetry data](#viewing-telemetry-data)
- [Next steps](#whats-next)

You can find the complete source code for this tutorial
[on GitHub](https://github.com/denoland/examples/tree/main/with-hyperdx).

## Set up the app

For this tutorial, we'll use a simple chat application to demonstrate how to
export telemetry data. You can find the
[code for the app on GitHub](https://github.com/denoland/examples/tree/main/with-hyperdx).

Either take a copy of that repository or create a
[main.ts](https://github.com/denoland/examples/blob/main/with-hyperdx/main.ts)
file and a
[.env](https://github.com/denoland/examples/blob/main/with-hyperdx/.env.example)
file.

In order to run the app you will need an OpenAI API key. You can get one by
signing up for an account at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/signup) and
creating a new secret key. You can find your API key in the
[API keys section](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) of your OpenAI
account. Once you have an API key, set up an `OPENAI_API-KEY` environment
variable in your `.env` file:

```env title=".env"
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

## Set up the collector

First, create a free HyperDX account to get your API key. Then, we'll set up two
files to configure the OpenTelemetry collector:

1. Create a `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
FROM otel/opentelemetry-collector:latest

COPY otel-collector.yml /otel-config.yml

CMD ["--config", "/otel-config.yml"]
```

This Dockerfile:

- Uses the official OpenTelemetry Collector as the base image
- Copies your configuration into the container
- Sets up the collector to use your config when it starts

2. Create a file called `otel-collector.yml`:

```yml title="otel-collector.yml"
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318

exporters:
  otlphttp/hdx:
    endpoint: "https://in-otel.hyperdx.io"
    headers:
      authorization: $_HYPERDX_API_KEY
    compression: gzip

processors:
  batch:

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlphttp/hdx]
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlphttp/hdx]
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlphttp/hdx]
```

This configuration file sets up the OpenTelemetry collector to receive telemetry
data from your application and export it to HyperDX. It includes:

- The receivers section accepts data via gRPC (4317) and HTTP (4318)
- The Exporters section sends data to HyperDX with compression and
  authentication
- The processors section batches telemetry data for efficient transmission
- The pipelines section defines separate flows for logs, traces, and metrics

Build and run the docker instance to start collecting your telemetry data with
the following command:

```sh
docker build -t otel-collector . && docker run -p 4317:4317 -p 4318:4318 otel-collector
```

## Generating telemetry data

Now that we have the app and the docker container set up, we can start
generating telemetry data. Run your application with these environment variables
to send data to the collector:

```sh
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318 \
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=chat-app \
OTEL_DENO=true \
deno run --unstable-otel --allow-net --allow-env --env-file --allow-read main.ts
```

This command:

- Points the OpenTelemetry exporter to your local collector (`localhost:4318`)
- Names your service "chat-app" in HyperDX
- Enables Deno's OpenTelemetry integration
- Runs your application with the necessary permissions

To generate some telemetry data, make a few requests to your running application
in your browser at [`http://localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000).

Each request will:

1. Generate traces as it flows through your application
2. Send logs from your application's console output
3. Create metrics about the request performance
4. Forward all this data through the collector to HyperDX

## Viewing telemetry data

In your HyperDX dashboard, you'll see different views of your telemetry data:

### Logs View

Click any log to see details:

### Request Traces

See all logs within a single request:

### Metrics Dashboard

ðŸ¦• Now that you have telemetry export working, you could:

1. Add custom spans and attributes to better understand your application
2. Set up alerts based on latency or error conditions
3. Deploy your application and collector to production using platforms like:
   - [Fly.io](https://docs.deno.com/examples/deploying_deno_with_docker/)
   - [Digital Ocean](https://docs.deno.com/examples/digital_ocean_tutorial/)
   - [AWS Lightsail](https://docs.deno.com/examples/aws_lightsail_tutorial/)
