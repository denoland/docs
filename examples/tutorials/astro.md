[Astro](https://astro.build/) is a modern web framework focused on
content-centric websites, which leverages islands architecture and sends zero
JavaScript to the client by default. You can see the
[finished app on GitHub](https://github.com/denoland/tutorial-with-astro).

You can see a live version of the app on
[Deno Deploy](https://tutorial-with-astro.deno.deno.net/).

:::info Deploy your own

Want to skip the tutorial and deploy the finished app right now? Click the
button below to instantly deploy your own copy of the complete Astro dinosaur
app to Deno Deploy. You'll get a live, working application that you can
customize and modify as you learn!

:::

## Scaffold an Astro project

Astro provides a CLI tool to quickly scaffold a new Astro project. In your
terminal, run the following command to create a new Astro project with Deno.

```sh
deno init --npm astro@latest
```

For this tutorial, we’ll select the “Empty” template so we can start from
scratch and we'll install the dependencies.

this will set us up with a basic Astro project structure, including a
`package.json` file, and a `src` directory where our application code will live.

## Start the Astro server

We can start the local Astro server with the `dev` task. In your terminal,
change directory into your new project and run run

```sh
deno task dev
```

This will start the Astro development server, which will watch for changes in
your files and automatically reload the page in your browser. You should see a
message indicating that the server is running on `http://localhost:4321`.

Upon visiting the output URL in your browser, you should see a very basic Astro
welcome page.

## Build out the app architecture

Now that we have a basic Astro project set up, let's build out the architecture
of our app. We'll create a few directories to organize our code and set up some
basic routing. Create the following directories

```text
src/
    ├── data/
    ├── lib/
    └── pages/
        └── index.astro
```

## Add dinosaur data

In the `data` directory, create a new file called `data.json` file, which will
contain the hard coded dinosaur data.

Copy and paste
[this json file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denoland/tutorial-with-astro/refs/heads/main/src/data/data.json)
into the `data.json` file. (If you were building a real app, you would probably
fetch this data from a database or an external API.)

## Set up the business logic

Next, we’ll create a `lib` directory to hold our business logic. In this case,
we’ll create a file called `dinosaur-service.ts` that will contain a function to
fetch the dinosaur data. Create `src/lib/dinosaur-service.ts` with the following
code:

```ts title="src/lib/dinosaur-service.ts"
// Simple utility functions for working with dinosaur data
import dinosaursData from "../data/data.json";

export interface Dinosaur {
  name?: string;
  description: string;
}

export class DinosaurService {
  private static dinosaurs: Dinosaur[] = dinosaursData;

  // Get all dinosaurs with names (filter out unnamed ones)
  static getNamedDinosaurs(): Dinosaur[] {
    return this.dinosaurs.filter((dino) => dino.name);
  }

  // Create a URL-friendly slug from dinosaur name
  static createSlug(name: string): string {
    return name
      .toLowerCase()
      .replace(/[^a-z0-9]+/g, "-")
      .replace(/^-+|-+$/g, "");
  }

  // Get dinosaur by slug
  static getDinosaurBySlug(slug: string): Dinosaur | undefined {
    return this.dinosaurs.find((dino) => {
      if (!dino.name) return false;
      return this.createSlug(dino.name) === slug;
    });
  }

  // Get all dinosaurs with their slugs for linking
  static getDinosaursWithSlugs() {
    return this.getNamedDinosaurs().map((dino) => ({
      ...dino,
      slug: this.createSlug(dino.name!),
    }));
  }
}

export default DinosaurService;
```

This file contains a `DinosaurService` class with methods to get all dinosaurs,
create a URL-friendly slug from a dinosaur name, and get a dinosaur by its slug.

## Update the index page to use the service

Now we can update our `index.astro` page to use the `DinosaurService` to fetch
the dinosaur data and render it as a list of links. Update the
`src/pages/index.astro` file to look like this:

```jsx title="src/pages/index.astro"
---
import DinosaurService from '../lib/dinosaur-service';
import '../../styles/index.css';

// Get all dinosaurs with slugs for linking
const dinosaursWithSlugs = DinosaurService.getDinosaursWithSlugs();
---

<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8" />
		<link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg" />
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
		<meta name="generator" content={Astro.generator} />
		<title>Dinosaur Directory</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>🦕 Dinosaur Directory</h1>
		<p>Click on any dinosaur name to learn more about it!</p>
		
		<div class="dinosaur-list">
			{dinosaursWithSlugs.map((dinosaur) => (
				<a href={`/dinosaur/${dinosaur.slug}`} class="dinosaur-link">
					{dinosaur.name}
				</a>
			))}
		</div>
	</body>
</html>
```

We import the `DinosaurService`, then map over the dinosaurs to create links to
individual dinosaur pages.

## Create individual dinosaur pages

Next, we’ll create individual pages for each dinosaur. In the `src/pages`
directory, create a directory called `dinosaurs`, and inside that directory,
create a file called `[slug].astro`. This file will be used to render the
individual dinosaur pages:

```jsx title="src/pages/dinosaurs/[slug].astro"
---
import DinosaurService from '../../lib/dinosaur-service';
import '../../styles/index.css';

export async function getStaticPaths() {
    const dinosaursWithSlugs = DinosaurService.getDinosaursWithSlugs();
    
    return dinosaursWithSlugs.map((dinosaur) => ({
        params: { slug: dinosaur.slug },
        props: { dinosaur }
    }));
}

const { dinosaur } = Astro.props;
---

<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
        <meta name="generator" content={Astro.generator} />
        <title>{dinosaur.name} - Dinosaur Directory</title>
        <meta name="description" content={dinosaur.description} />
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://demo-styles.deno.deno.net/styles.css">
    </head>
    <body class="dinosaur">
        <main>
            <h1>🦕 {dinosaur.name}</h1>
            
            <div class="info-card">
                <p>{dinosaur.description}</p>
            </div>
            
            <a href="/" class="btn-secondary">Back to Directory</a>
        </main>
    </body>
</html>
```

This file uses the `getStaticPaths` function to generate static paths for each
dinosaur based on the slugs we created earlier. The `Astro.props` object will
contain the dinosaur data for the specific slug, which we can then render in the
page.

## Add some styles

You can style your app to make it your own in the `src/styles/index.css`. This
file is imported in both the `index.astro` and `[slug].astro` files, so any
styles you add here will apply to both pages.

## Build and deploy

Astro has a built-in command to build your site for production:

```sh
deno run build
```

This will:

- Generate static HTML files for each page in the `dist` directory.
- Optimize your assets (CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) for production.

You can deploy this app to your favorite cloud provider. We recommend using
[Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy) for a simple and easy deployment
experience. You can deploy your app directly from GitHub, simply create a GitHub
repository and push your code there, then connect it to Deno Deploy.

### Create a GitHub repository

[Create a new GitHub repository](https://github.com/new), then initialize and
push your app to GitHub:

```sh
git init -b main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your_github_username>/<your_repo_name>.git
git add .
git commit -am 'initial commit'
git push -u origin main
```

### Deploy to Deno Deploy

Once your app is on GitHub, you can
[deploy to Deno Deploy](https://console.deno.com/) dashboard.

For a walkthrough of deploying your app, check out the
[Deno Deploy tutorial](/examples/deno_deploy_tutorial/).

🦕 Now you can scaffold and develop an Astro app that will run on Deno! You
could extend this app by adding more features, such as user authentication, a
database, or even a CMS. We can’t wait to see what you build with Astro and
Deno!
