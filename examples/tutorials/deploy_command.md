The `deno deploy` command provides a powerful CLI for deploying and managing
applications on [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy).

If you already have an app to deploy you can skip to
[Deploying your application](#deploy-your-application), or read on to make and
then deploy a simple app.

## Prerequisites

Before using the deploy command, you will need a Deno Deploy account, and a Deno
Deploy organization set up on that account.

To create an account visit
[the Deno Deploy dashboard](https://console.deno.com/). To create an
organization, follow the steps in the

## Create a simple web application

First, let's create a basic HTTP server that will serve as our application.

Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir my-deploy-app
cd my-deploy-app
```

Initialize a new Deno project:

```bash
deno init
```

Replace the contents of `main.ts` with a simple HTTP server:

```ts title="main.ts"
Deno.serve({ port: 8000 }, (req) => {
  const url = new URL(req.url);
  const userAgent = req.headers.get("user-agent") || "unknown";
  const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();

  // Log every request
  console.log(
    `[${timestamp}] ${req.method} ${url.pathname} - User-Agent: ${userAgent}`,
  );

  // Simple routing
  if (url.pathname === "/") {
    console.log("Serving home page");
    return new Response(
      `
      <html>
        <head><title>My Deploy App</title></head>
        <body>
          <h1>Welcome to My Deploy App!</h1>
          <p>This app was deployed using the deno deploy command.</p>
          <nav>
            <a href="/about">About</a> | 
            <a href="/api/status">API Status</a> |
            <a href="/api/error">Test Error</a>
          </nav>
        </body>
      </html>
    `,
      {
        headers: { "content-type": "text/html" },
      },
    );
  }

  if (url.pathname === "/about") {
    console.log("Serving about page");
    return new Response(
      `
      <html>
        <head><title>About - My Deploy App</title></head>
        <body>
          <h1>About This App</h1>
          <p>This is a simple demonstration of deploying with the deno deploy CLI.</p>
          <p>Check the logs to see request information!</p>
          <a href="/">‚Üê Back to Home</a>
        </body>
      </html>
    `,
      {
        headers: { "content-type": "text/html" },
      },
    );
  }

  if (url.pathname === "/api/status") {
    const responseData = {
      status: "ok",
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      message: "API is running successfully",
      requestCount: Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000) + 1, // Simulate request counter
    };

    console.log("API status check - all systems operational");
    console.log(`Response data:`, responseData);

    return Response.json(responseData);
  }

  if (url.pathname === "/api/error") {
    // This endpoint demonstrates error logging
    console.error("Error endpoint accessed - demonstrating error logging");
    console.warn("This is a warning message that will appear in logs");

    return Response.json({
      error: "This is a test error for demonstration",
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      tip: "Check the logs with: deno deploy logs",
    }, { status: 500 });
  }

  // 404 for all other routes
  console.warn(`404 - Route not found: ${url.pathname}`);
  return new Response("Not Found", { status: 404 });
});
```

### Test your application locally

Update the `dev` task in the `deno.json` file in the root, to allow network
access:

```json
"dev": "deno run -N --watch main.ts"
```

Then run the dev command:

```sh
deno run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000` to see your application running. Try navigating to
the different routes (`/about`, `/api/status`, and `/api/error`) to verify
everything works. You'll notice that each request is logged to the console -
these are the same logs you'll be able to see when the app is deployed!

## Authentication

The `deno deploy` command handles authentication automatically. When you first
run a deploy command, it will prompt you to authenticate. Run the deploy command
with the `--help` flag to see all available options:

```bash
deno deploy --help
```

:::note Deno Deploy organization requirement

The `deno deploy` command requires a Deno Deploy organization. If you don't
already have an organization set up in your account, you can create one through
the [Deno Deploy web app](https://console.deno.com).

:::

## Deploy your application

Now let's use the `deno deploy` command to deploy your application! Ensure that
you are in the root directory of your project and run:

```bash
deno deploy
```

Select the appropriate options in the terminal when prompted.

The deployment process will:

1. Make a tarball of your application code
2. Upload the tarball to Deno Deploy
3. Unpack the tarball
4. Build and deploy to the edge network
5. Provide you with a live URL

You have now successfully deployed your application! You can visit the returned
URL to see your app in action.

If you need to make changes to your application, simply update your code and run
the `deno deploy` command again.

Our demo application had some logging built in, we can use the built in logging
features of Deno Deploy to monitor the application.

## Monitoring your application

### View application logs

After deploying your application, you can stream live logs to see exactly what's
happening on the app:

```bash
deno deploy logs
```

Visit your application URL and navigate to different pages. You'll see logs
like:

- Request logs showing HTTP method, path, and user agent
- Info logs from `console.log()` calls
- Warning logs from `console.warn()` calls
- Error logs from `console.error()` calls

Open your app url in the browser and try visiting the `/api/error` endpoint to
see the error logs in action.

### View logs for a specific time range

To view logs for a specific time range, you can use the `--start` and `--end`
flags:

```bash
deno deploy logs \
  --start "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z" \
  --end "2024-01-01T23:59:59Z"
```

## Managing environment variables

Your application might need environment variables for configuration. The
`deno deploy` command provides comprehensive environment variable management.

### List environment variables

You can view all environment variables for your application:

```bash
deno deploy env list
```

### Add and update environment variables

To add individual environment variables, use the `deno deploy env add` command,
for example:

```bash
deno deploy env add API_KEY "your-secret-key"
deno deploy env add DATABASE_URL "postgresql://..."
```

Then to update them, use the `deno deploy env update-value` command, for
example:

```bash
deno deploy env update-value API_KEY "new-secret-key"
deno deploy env update-value DATABASE_URL "postgresql://new-user:new-pass@localhost/new-db"
```

### Delete environment variables

To delete an environment variable, use the `deno deploy env delete` command, for
example:

```bash
deno deploy env delete API_KEY
deno deploy env delete DATABASE_URL
```

### Load environment variables from a .env file

You can also use an `.env` file to load your environment variables to your
deployed app:

```bash
deno deploy env load .env
```

command! Check out the [`deno deploy` docs](/runtime/reference/cli/deploy/) for
