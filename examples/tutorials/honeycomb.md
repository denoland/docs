[Honeycomb.io](https://honeycomb.io) is a powerful observability platform
designed for debugging and understanding complex, modern distributed systems,
with support for real-time, high-cardinality data, as well as sophisticated
event correlation.

In this tutorial, we'll show how to export telemetry data from your Deno or
Node.js project to Honeycomb.io without any additional code or config:

- console.logs associated with HTTP requests
- traces
- metrics

You can view the source of this tutorial [on GitHub](https://example.com).

## Setup your app

Since this tutorial focuses on how to export data to Honeycomb.io, we'll use a
very simple chat application. Note that you can use any Deno (or Node.js)
program. What's important is that you run it with Deno and the OTel flag
enabled:

```tsx
$ OTEL_DENO=true OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=chat-app deno run --unstable-otel --allow-net --allow-read --allow-env --env-file main.ts
```

## Setup Honeycomb.io

If you haven't yet, create a free Honeycomb.io account. Once you have created an
account, you'll receive a Honeycomb.io API key. We'll need this in the next step
when we setup the OpenTelemetry collector.

Next, let's setup the OpenTelemetry collector with two new files: a `Dockerfile`
and a `otel-collector.yml` configuration file. These files will tell the
collector to export OTel data to Honeycomb.io.

In the `Dockerfile`, we'll pull from the
[`otel/opentelemetry-collector` image](https://hub.docker.com/r/otel/opentelemetry-collector).
Here, we use `latest` tag, but in production, we recommend using a specific
version:

```bash
# Dockerfile

FROM otel/opentelemetry-collector:latest

# Copy the OTel Collector config into the container
COPY otel-collector.yml /otel-config.yml

# Run the OTel Collector with the provided config
CMD ["--config", "/otel-config.yml"]
```

Next, let's create our `otel-collector.yml` . Note that your Honeycomb.io API
key is used in the `exporters` section, as the `x-honeycomb-team` header:

```yml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318

exporters:
  otlp:
    endpoint: "api.honeycomb.io:443"
    headers:
      x-honeycomb-team: $_HONEYCOMB_API_KEY

processors:
  batch:
    timeout: 5s
    send_batch_size: 5000

service:
  pipelines:
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

Now we can start the OTel collector service with the following command:

```bash
$ docker build -t otel-collector . && docker run -p 4317:4317 -p 4318:4318 otel-collector

```

Once the service is running, make a few requests on your Deno app. Afterwards,
when we go to our Honeycomb.io account, we can see telemetry data:

We can view our logs:

![Viewing logs in Honeycomb](./images/how-to/honeycomb/honeycomb2.webp)

As well as traces:

And explore each span operation within a trace:

## What's next

You can use this configuration to export telemetry data from any Deno or Node.js
program to Honeycomb.io.

You can also host this — the app and the OTel collector service — on any VPS
platform via Docker, such as
[Fly.io](https://docs.deno.com/examples/deploying_deno_with_docker/),
[Digital Ocean](https://docs.deno.com/examples/digital_ocean_tutorial/),
[Amazon](https://docs.deno.com/examples/aws_lightsail_tutorial/), and more.
