[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a popular framework for building
server-side-rendered applications. It is built on top of React and provides a
lot of features out of the box.

In this tutorial, we'll build a
[simple Next.js application](https://tutorial-with-next.deno.deno.net/) and run
it with Deno. The app will display a list of dinosaurs. When you click on one,
it'll take you to a dinosaur page with more details.

You can see the
[complete app on GitHub](https://github.com/denoland/tutorial-with-next/tree/main).

## Create a Next.js app with Deno

Next provides a CLI tool to quickly scaffold a new Next.js app. In your terminal
run the following command to create a new Next.js app with Deno:

```sh
deno run -A npm:create-next-app@latest
```

When prompted, select the default options to create a new Next.js app with
TypeScript.

Next.js has some dependencies that still rely on `Object.prototype.__proto__`
and requires CommonJS module support. To configure Deno for Next.js
compatibility, update your `deno.json` file with the following configuration:

```json deno.json
{
  "nodeModulesDir": "auto",
  "unstable": [
    "unsafe-proto",
    "sloppy-imports"
  ],
  "compilerOptions": {
    "lib": [
      "dom",
      "dom.iterable",
      "esnext"
    ],
    "strict": true,
    "jsx": "preserve"
  },
  "tasks": {
    "dev": "deno run -A --unstable-detect-cjs npm:next@latest dev",
    "build": "deno run -A --unstable-detect-cjs npm:next@latest build",
    "start": "deno run -A --unstable-detect-cjs npm:next@latest start"
  }
}
```

This configuration includes:

- `nodeModulesDir: "auto"` - Enables npm package lifecycle scripts
- `unstable: ["unsafe-proto", "sloppy-imports"]` - Required for Next.js
  compatibility
- `--unstable-detect-cjs` flag - Enables CommonJS module detection for Next.js
  dependencies

Now you can serve your new Next.js app:

```sh
deno run dev
```

This will start the Next.js development server using Deno. The `deno task dev`
command runs the Next.js development server with the necessary flags for
CommonJS compatibility.

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app in the
browser.

## Add a backend

The next step is to add a backend API. We'll create a very simple API that
returns information about dinosaurs.

We'll use Next.js's
[built in API route handlers](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers)
to set up our dinosaur API. Next.js uses a file-system-based router, where the
folder structure directly defines the routes.

We'll define three routes, The first route at `/api` will return the string
`Welcome to the dinosaur API`, then we'll set up `/api/dinosaurs` to return all
the dinosaurs, and finally `/api/dinosaur/[dinosaur]` to return a specific
dinosaur based on the name in the URL.

### /api/

In the `src/app` folder of your new project, create an `api` folder. In that
folder, create a `route.ts` file, which will handle requests to `/api/.

Copy and paste the following code into the `api/route.ts` file:

```ts title="route.ts"
export function GET() {
  return Response.json("welcome to the dinosaur API");
}
```

This code defines a simple route handler that returns a JSON response with the
string `welcome to the dinosaur API`.

### /api/data.json

In the `api` folder, create a `data.json` file, which will contain the hard
coded dinosaur data. Copy and paste
[this json file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denoland/deno-vue-example/main/api/data.json)
into the `data.json` file.

### /api/dinosaurs

In the `api` folder, create a folder called `dinosaurs`, in that create a
`route.ts` file which will handle requests to `/api/dinosaurs`. In this route
we'll read the `data.json` file and return the dinosaurs as JSON:

```ts title="route.ts"
import data from "./data.json" with { type: "json" };

export function GET() {
  return Response.json(data);
}
```

### /api/dinosaurs/[dinosaur]

And for the final route, `/api/dinosaurs/[dinosaur]`, we'll create a folder
called `[dinosaur]` in the `dinosaurs` directory. In there, create a `route.ts`
file. In this file we'll read the `data.json` file, find the dinosaur with the
name in the URL, and return it as JSON:

```ts title="route.ts"
import data from "../../data.json" with { type: "json" };

type RouteParams = { params: Promise<{ dinosaur: string }> };

export const GET = async (_request: Request, { params }: RouteParams) => {
  const { dinosaur } = await params;

  if (!dinosaur) {
    return Response.json("No dinosaur name provided.");
  }

  const dinosaurData = data.find((item) =>
    item.name.toLowerCase() === dinosaur.toLowerCase()
  );

  return Response.json(dinosaurData ? dinosaurData : "No dinosaur found.");
};
```

Now, if you run the app with `deno task dev` and visit
`http://localhost:3000/api/dinosaurs/brachiosaurus` in your browser, you should
see the details of the brachiosaurus dinosaur.

## Build the frontend

Now that we have our backend API set up, let's build the frontend to display the
dinosaur data.

### Define the dinosaur type

Firstly we'll set up a new type, to define the shape of the dinosaur data. In
the `app` directory, create a `types.ts` file and add the following code:

```ts title="types.ts"
export type Dino = { name: string; description: string };
```

### Update the homepage

We'll update the `page.tsx` file in the `app` directory to fetch the dinosaur
data from our API and display it as a list of links.

To execute client-side code in Next.js we need to use the `use Client` directive
at the top of the file. Then we'll import the modules that we'll need in this
page and export the default function that will render the page:

```tsx title="page.tsx"
"use client";

import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { Dino } from "./types";
import Link from "next/link";

export default function Home() {
}
```

Inside the body of the `Home` function, we'll define a state variable to store
the dinosaur data, and a `useEffect` hook to fetch the data from the API when
the component mounts:

```tsx title="page.tsx"
const [dinosaurs, setDinosaurs] = useState<Dino[]>([]);

useEffect(() => {
  (async () => {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/dinosaurs`);
    const allDinosaurs = await response.json() as Dino[];
    setDinosaurs(allDinosaurs);
  })();
}, []);
```

Beneath this, still inside the body of the `Home` function, we'll return a list
of links, each linking to the dinosaur's page:

```tsx title="page.tsx"
return (
  <main id="content">
    <h1>Welcome to the Dinosaur app</h1>
    <p>Click on a dinosaur below to learn more.</p>
    <ul>
      {dinosaurs.map((dinosaur: Dino) => {
        return (
          <li key={dinosaur.name}>
            <Link href={`/${dinosaur.name.toLowerCase()}`}>
              {dinosaur.name}
            </Link>
          </li>
        );
      })}
    </ul>
  </main>
);
```

### Create the dinosaur page

Inside the `app` directory, create a new folder called `[dinosaur]`. Inside this
folder create a `page.tsx` file. This file will fetch the details of a specific
dinosaur from the API and render them on the page.

Much like the homepage, we'll need client side code, and we'll import the
modules we need and export a default function. We'll pass the incoming to the
function and set up a type for this parameter:

```tsx title="[dinosaur]/page.tsx"
"use client";

import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { Dino } from "../types";
import Link from "next/link";

type RouteParams = { params: Promise<{ dinosaur: string }> };

export default function Dinosaur({ params }: RouteParams) {
}
```

Inside the body of the `Dinosaur` function we'll get the selected dinosaur from
the request, set up a state variable to store the dinosaur data, and write a
`useEffect` hook to fetch the data from the API when the component mounts:

```tsx title="[dinosaur]/page.tsx"
const selectedDinosaur = params.then((params) => params.dinosaur);
const [dinosaur, setDino] = useState<Dino>({ name: "", description: "" });

useEffect(() => {
  (async () => {
    const resp = await fetch(`/api/dinosaurs/${await selectedDinosaur}`);
    const dino = await resp.json() as Dino;
    setDino(dino);
  })();
}, []);
```

Finally, still inside the `Dinosaur` function body, we'll return a paragraph
element containing the dinosaur's name and description:

```tsx title="[dinosaur]/page.tsx"
return (
  <main id="content">
    <h1>{dinosaur.name}</h1>
    <p>{dinosaur.description}</p>
    <Link href="/">ðŸ   Back to all dinosaurs</Link>
  </main>
);
```

### Add some styles

Let's add some basic styles to make the app look nicer. Update your
`app/globals.css` file with the
[styles from this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denoland/tutorial-with-next/refs/heads/main/src/app/globals.css).

## Run the app

Now you can run the app with `deno run dev` and visit `http://localhost:3000` in
your browser to see the list of dinosaurs. Click on a dinosaur to see more
details!

## Deploy the app

Now that you have your working Next.js app, you can deploy it to the web with
Deno Deploy.

For the best experience, you can deploy your app directly from GitHub, which
will set up automated deployments. Create a GitHub repository and push your app
there.

[Create a new GitHub repository](https://github.com/new), then initialize and
push your app to GitHub:

```sh
git init -b main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your_github_username>/<your_repo_name>.git
git add .
git commit -am 'my next app'
git push -u origin main
```

Once your app is on GitHub, you can
[deploy it to Deno Deploy](https://console.deno.com/).

For a walkthrough of deploying your app, check out the
[Deno Deploy tutorial](/examples/deno_deploy_tutorial/).

ðŸ¦• Now you can build and run a Next.js app with Deno! To build on your app you
could consider [adding a database](/runtime/tutorials/connecting_to_databases/)
to replace your `data.json` file, or consider
[writing some tests](/runtime/fundamentals/testing/) to make your app reliable
and production ready.
