## Description of video

A short introduction to Deno and its history

## Transcript and code

Deno is an open source runtime for JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly
projects that's built on V8 and Rust. It's modern, it's fast, it's flexible, and
it's secure by default.

Deno was created by Ryan Dahl, the creator of Node.js, and in 2018, he gave
[a famous talk at JSConf EU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3BM9TB-8yA) about
regrets that he had about Node. And Deno provides solutions to all of them.

With the hindsight of someone who's been there, Deno gives us a runtime that's
thought a lot about the details. Details like TypeScript support by default. You
can run or import TypeScript without installing anything more than the Deno CLI.
Deno has a built-in TypeScript compiler, so it'll just run your TypeScript code
without any extra configuration.

Details like linting, formatting, and testing. Deno is an all-in-one toolchain
that you can use to get started with your project without having to use all of
your finite time on earth having to configure it. Details like web standards.
Deno is built on web standards that you might recognize, like Fetch and
WebSockets.

You don't have to learn anything new to use them. If you've used them in the
browser, you're ready to use them in Deno. Deno is secure by default. You have
to specifically enable permissions for sensitive APIs like the network, the file
system, environment access. Deno has you opt into these permissions like you
would to opt into geolocation in the browser.

[In this course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPTOo4k8-GE&list=PLvvLnBDNuTEov9EBIp3MMfHlBxaKGRWTe),
we're going to walk through the most important features of Deno with hands-on
activities. Whether you've experimented with Deno in the past, or this is all
new to you, I think you're going to like it here.
