## Video description

In this video, we use the deno.json file to manage dependencies and
configurations in your Deno projects. Learn how to create and configure tasks
like 'start' and 'format' to streamline your workflow. We'll also explore
customizing formatting and linting rules, and understand the concept of import
maps for cleaner imports. Then we'll take a look at compatibility between Deno's
deno.json and Node's package.json for seamless project integration.
