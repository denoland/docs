This page is a short entrypoint for LLMs and AI agents consuming the Deno
documentation.

## Key resources

- [llms-summary.txt](/llms-summary.txt): compact, high-signal index
- [llms.txt](/llms.txt): full section index
- [llms.json](/llms.json): structured index (Orama summary)
- [llms-full.txt](/llms-full.txt): full content dump (large)
- [Site search](/): use the on-site search UI for human browsing

## Usage notes

- Prefer `llms-summary.txt` for quick orientation; fall back to `llms.txt` for
  breadth.
- Use `llms.json` when you need structured metadata (category, section,
  docType).
- `llms-full.txt` is large; only fetch it when you need full-text extraction.
- When possible, follow canonical URLs for stable citations.
